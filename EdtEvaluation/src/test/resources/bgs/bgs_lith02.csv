(C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation.

The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above).

However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames.

(B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene.

(B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en','Ground surface.@en',NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/M,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,'Wolvercote Sand And Gravel Member@en','0 to c,3m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_48752;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_49677;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50263;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50264;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50265;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50631;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50680;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50874;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50918;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50985;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51002;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51363;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51515;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51838;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51966;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_52086;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_52112;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_52988;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_53046,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,WV@en,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Wolvercote Sand And Gravel Member@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/onshoreOffshore/ONSHORE,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4171;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4173;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4662;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4663;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4168;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4660;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4661,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Predominantly cold phase sands and gravels that underlie the Wolvercote or Third Terrace of BGS maps.

Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation.

Obviously Lower Severn would seem appropriate. The Upper Severn is entirely within the Devensian limit - in pre-Devensian times it was probably a tributary of the Dee.This is a common problem with rivers that have had major diversions during the Pleistocene e.g. Thames and Trent. (B) The list of members relates to the ?lower Severn? below Bridgnorth but even there might not be fully comprehensive if ?awkward? rivers like the Teme (see below) are included. (C) It is impractical to give a fully comprehensive definition of the base in lithological terms. (D) The Upper Boundary might need modification if head etc is not included in this type of Formation. (E) Thickness estimates are subject to possible modification. (F) Listed 50K sheets are those that include a portion of the entire Severn catchment. More work might be needed to decide if some rivers like the Teme (the valley of which includes pre-Devensian terraces related to the River Wye!), or indeed the Upper (later Devensian) Severn (see above) should be included.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/F,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/CurrentStatus/CURRENT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,SEVN@en,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,'Severn catchment (excluding Warwickshire Avon).@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BGT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/HHTD;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/KRT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/PSTT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/SPHT,'0 to c.10m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Theme/SPRFCL,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SpatialScope/GENRAL,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/?,NaN,NaN

(B) Terrace surface some 55m above modern Severn alluvial floodplain in the Worcester area, descending to about 45m downstream, at type locality, in the southern part of Sheet 216. Probably represents downstream equivalent of the Dunsmore Gravel Member of the Wolston Formation, ie. Anglian outwash terrace (and younger than the Woolridge Gravel Member, which occurs in the lower Severn valley). (C) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) Severn terraces, particularly the older ones, need reviewing and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect ? hence the section of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. The Spring Hill as such was not recognised prior to BGS work on sheet 216, although some outcrops of ?Sixth Terrace?, which (mostly) seem to be Spring Hill, were mapped on Sheet 182. On Sheet 234 some high gravels are classified as Wills? Woolridge Terrace, which is now (as Woolridge Member) included in the Wolston Formation (outwash gravels) but some look more likely to be Spring Hill on the basis of elevation. (E) According to the compiler?s favoured scheme for a two-phase Anglian (believed to be the only one that fits the evidence, despite the so-far missing stage 11 interglacial) the Spring Hill is Stage 10 distal outwash and the Woolridge Stage 12, probably more proximal, outwash.

(B) Dating of this terrace is contentious; as yet the crucial Fladbury Bed beneath it has no age-diagnostic fauna and its C14 date of c.38K (within MIS 3) may be a minimum. (C) Terrace surface typically some 5m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.9m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation. (G) Only 50K maps on the main course of the Avon are listed.

(C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however.

(D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate. In particular the depiction of this Terrace 1 on maps, particularly in the lower Avon, is suspect. It is divided into 1a and 1b &quot;facets&quot;, which might be expected to converge with the Power House (Terrace 1) and Worcester (2) of the Severn, respectively. However the Power House, at least, is [supposedly] below the floodplain at the confluence, whereas patches of Avon Terrace 1, as far down as the confluence, lie 1 to 2m above.
