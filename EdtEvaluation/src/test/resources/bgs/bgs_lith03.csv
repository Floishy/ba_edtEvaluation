The upper part locally includes a rubified palaeosol (Hykeham Soil; Ipswichian). The Member is correlated with the Ockbrook Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation) and Knighton Sand and Gravel Member (Soar Valley Formation).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Fulbeck Terrace. Typically a clean, well-sorted medium-grained sand with gravel that at depth is dominated by subangular and subrounded pebbles of Jurassic limestone (mainly Lias Group and Lincolnshire Limestone Formation), with a smaller proportion of other Jurassic lithologies, flint, &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite, etc, derived from older drift deposits. Commonly appears dominated by &quot;Bunter&quot; and flint pebbles near the surface due to decalcification. Infills a shallow channel partly coinciding with the valley of the modern River Brant, extending northnortheastwards from Woolsthorpe to Auborne. Terrace surface falls to c.6m OD at the northern end where the deposits are covered by Brant alluvium and probably are truncated by the deeper channel of the River Witham. Sections show cryogenic involutions and epigenetic ice wedge casts infilled with coversand. Basal part locally includes channel-filling organic silts (Little Syke Bed), which yield a temperate fauna and flora assigned to MIS 5e. Correlated with Beeston Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation), and Scarle Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en;Gravels, sands and loams that underlie the Hemington Terrace. Forms a terrace typically c.0.5 to 1m above the modern floodplain in the type area, and often distinguishable from the latter by the presence of mediaeval ridge and furrow. Generally comprises a lower unit of planar cross-bedded (laterally accreted, meandering river) gravel (up to 5m) and an upper unit of overbank silt (up to 2m); may also include organic muds in channels at the base.

definition compiler notes: At Newark itself this terrace seems to be at c.18m, which (depending upon how the profile is drawn) could read as only 7m above the Trent - hence previous confusion with the Beeston Terrace. However, the terrace here could be degraded in some way, because it is slightly higher than this &quot;downstream&quot;. If the profile is projected back towards Newark it &quot;ought&quot; to be 10 or 11m above the modern floodplain.@en;Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en;Partly because of misunderstandings about the age relationships, Howard (in Bowen, 1999) ascribed the downstream end of the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel (which would lie on Sheet 114) as a separate Bassingham Fen Member. The latter name is superfluous and is now subsumed into the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel.@en;As defined  this is a rather unsatisfactory portmanteau term to cover all the younger sands and gravels of the Proto-Trent and Witham areas that are not otherwise named. Very little is known about these deposits so  more specific names have not yet ben applied. Younger parts include Witham gravels of local derivation and, mainly on Sheet 102, there are deposits that might represent southwards outflow from Lake Humber.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

occur as fans, flat-topped plateaux, mounds, ridge systems and terraces.@en;Glaciolacustrine deposits infilling  basins and hollows associated with glaciofluvial outwash deposited during Late Devensian deglaciation.@en;Three types of landform are recognised associated with these deposits: Sinuous discontinous Esker ridges (single strand), typically  10-20m in height and up to c 1km in length. Elongated Mounds and hummocky topography with intervening poorly drained hollows (fluted kame and kettle topography). Flat-topped kame terraces standing up to 20m above the adajacent river floodplains, sandar plains, glaciofluvial fans and lower glaciofluial terraces flanking valleys infilled with Holocene fluvial and marine sediments. (All generally mapped as Glaciofluvial Sheet

definition compiler notes: At Newark itself this terrace seems to be at c.18m, which (depending upon how the profile is drawn) could read as only 7m above the Trent - hence previous confusion with the Beeston Terrace. However, the terrace here could be degraded in some way, because it is slightly higher than this &quot;downstream&quot;. If the profile is projected back towards Newark it &quot;ought&quot; to be 10 or 11m above the modern floodplain.@en;Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en;Partly because of misunderstandings about the age relationships, Howard (in Bowen, 1999) ascribed the downstream end of the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel (which would lie on Sheet 114) as a separate Bassingham Fen Member. The latter name is superfluous and is now subsumed into the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel.@en;As defined  this is a rather unsatisfactory portmanteau term to cover all the younger sands and gravels of the Proto-Trent and Witham areas that are not otherwise named. Very little is known about these deposits so  more specific names have not yet ben applied. Younger parts include Witham gravels of local derivation and, mainly on Sheet 102, there are deposits that might represent southwards outflow from Lake Humber.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

(C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation.

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

Commonly appears dominated by &quot;Bunter&quot; and flint pebbles near the surface due to decalcification. Infills a shallow channel partly coinciding with the valley of the modern River Brant, extending northnortheastwards from Woolsthorpe to Auborne. Terrace surface falls to c.6m OD at the northern end where the deposits are covered by Brant alluvium and probably are truncated by the deeper channel of the River Witham. Sections show cryogenic involutions and epigenetic ice wedge casts infilled with coversand. Basal part locally includes channel-filling organic silts (Little Syke Bed), which yield a temperate fauna and flora assigned to MIS 5e. Correlated with Beeston Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation), and Scarle Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en;Gravels, sands and loams that underlie the Hemington Terrace. Forms a terrace typically c.0.5 to 1m above the modern floodplain in the type area, and often distinguishable from the latter by the presence of mediaeval ridge and furrow. Generally comprises a lower unit of planar cross-bedded (laterally accreted, meandering river) gravel (up to 5m) and an upper unit of overbank silt (up to 2m); may also include organic muds in channels at the base. Gravel much as Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel, i.e. dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (c.80\%) with subordinate subangular flint, etc., but typically less sandy and orange-brown (not pinkish).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Holme Pierrepont Terrace. Generally pinkish, poorly sorted and compositionally rather immature matrix-supported, sandy, trough-cross bedded (braided river) gravels with syndepositional ice-wedge casts. Gravel dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (typically c.80\%), plus flint, Triassic and Upper Carboniferous sandstone, Lower Carboniferous cherts, etc, and other &quot;exotic&quot; lithogies. Forms a fairly well preserved terrace typically 1 to 2m above the floodplain in the upper and middle Trent, with the deposits extending beneath those of the younger Hemington Terrace and the floodplain alluvium.@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels representing the youngest deposits of the Proto-Trent, and the pre-Flandian deposits of the Witham. The former are typically dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, etc. but the latter have a greater proportion of flint and local Jurassic limestone, etc. Surface c.1 to 2m above the Trent floodplain, at Spalford, and typically 3 to 6m below Witham floodplain level in the Type Area. West of the Lincoln Gap, correlated with the Holme Pierrepont Member (Trent Valley Formation); whilst east of Lincoln Gap also includes older materials correlated with the Scarle and Fulbeck Sand and Gravel members (Trent Valley Formation) and Castle Sand and Gravel Member (Bain Valley Formation).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Martin Terrace of the lower Witham valley. At surface, dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, etc. Terrace preserved as extensive dissected remnants at c.+18m in the Type Area, i.e about 16m above the Witham Floodplain there. Correlated with the Eagle Moor Sand and Gravel west of the Lincoln Gap.@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Scarle Terrace. Gravel dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, and rarer Triassic sandstone, Lias limestone, etc. Infills a shallow channel diverging from the Trent at Collingham and extending northnortheastwards to North Scarle where it is apparently truncated by the Kirkstead Sand and Gravel Member. Surface is c.3 to 4m above the Trent floodplain, and up to c.2m above the adjoining Kirkstead/Holme Pierrepont Terrace. Correlated with Beeston Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation), and Fulbeck Sand and Gravel Member (Proto-Trent).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Southrey Terrace. At surface, dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (c.60\%) with subordinate subangular flint, etc. (c.40\%). Terrace surface highly dissected but rises to c.6 to 7m above the Witham floodplain in the Type Area. Associated silts yielding a temperate flora and fauna occur at at least two sites; these might occur at the base of the unit but relationships are uncertain. Correlated with the Balderton Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation, west of the Lincoln Gap) and the Egginton Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en;Reddened sands and gravels dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint. Underlies possible terrace remnants adjacent to the outcrop of the Balderton Sand and Gravel and with a terrace surface standing typically c.4 to 5m above the Balderton Terrace. Upper part locally includes a thin fluvio-aeolian coversand (Whisby Sand Bed, pre-Ipswichian) and rubified palaeosol (Hykeham Soil; Ipswichian). Tentatively correlated with the Etwall Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en',symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;SYMB^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Unconformable,

definition compiler notes: At Newark itself this terrace seems to be at c.18m, which (depending upon how the profile is drawn) could read as only 7m above the Trent - hence previous confusion with the Beeston Terrace. However, the terrace here could be degraded in some way, because it is slightly higher than this &quot;downstream&quot;. If the profile is projected back towards Newark it &quot;ought&quot; to be 10 or 11m above the modern floodplain.@en;Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en;Partly because of misunderstandings about the age relationships, Howard (in Bowen, 1999) ascribed the downstream end of the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel (which would lie on Sheet 114) as a separate Bassingham Fen Member. The latter name is superfluous and is now subsumed into the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel.@en;As defined  this is a rather unsatisfactory portmanteau term to cover all the younger sands and gravels of the Proto-Trent and Witham areas that are not otherwise named. Very little is known about these deposits so  more specific names have not yet ben applied.

The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above).

definition compiler notes: At Newark itself this terrace seems to be at c.18m, which (depending upon how the profile is drawn) could read as only 7m above the Trent - hence previous confusion with the Beeston Terrace. However, the terrace here could be degraded in some way, because it is slightly higher than this &quot;downstream&quot;. If the profile is projected back towards Newark it &quot;ought&quot; to be 10 or 11m above the modern floodplain.@en;Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en;Partly because of misunderstandings about the age relationships, Howard (in Bowen, 1999) ascribed the downstream end of the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel (which would lie on Sheet 114) as a separate Bassingham Fen Member. The latter name is superfluous and is now subsumed into the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel.@en;As defined  this is a rather unsatisfactory portmanteau term to cover all the younger sands and gravels of the Proto-Trent and Witham areas that are not otherwise named. Very little is known about these deposits so  more specific names have not yet ben applied. Younger parts include Witham gravels of local derivation and, mainly on Sheet 102, there are deposits that might represent southwards outflow from Lake Humber.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

(B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en','Ground surface.@en',NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/M,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,'Freeland Sand And Gravel Member@en','0 to c.4m, typically &lt;2m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_48752;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_49130;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_49677;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_50263;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_50264;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_50265;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_50476;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_50661;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_50874;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_50918;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_51363;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_51515;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_51832;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_51838;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_51966;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_51969;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_52070;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_52086;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_52312;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/FL_52547,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,FL@en,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Freeland Sand And Gravel Member@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/onshoreOffshore/ONSHORE,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/FL___mn__1639;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/FL_GSG;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/FL___mn__3336;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/FL___mn__4305;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/FL___mn__1638;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/FL___mn__3086;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/FL_SGUO,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Predominantly cold phase sands and gravels that underlie the Freeland Terrace.

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

definition compiler notes: At Newark itself this terrace seems to be at c.18m, which (depending upon how the profile is drawn) could read as only 7m above the Trent - hence previous confusion with the Beeston Terrace. However, the terrace here could be degraded in some way, because it is slightly higher than this &quot;downstream&quot;. If the profile is projected back towards Newark it &quot;ought&quot; to be 10 or 11m above the modern floodplain.@en;Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en;Partly because of misunderstandings about the age relationships, Howard (in Bowen, 1999) ascribed the downstream end of the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel (which would lie on Sheet 114) as a separate Bassingham Fen Member. The latter name is superfluous and is now subsumed into the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel.@en;As defined  this is a rather unsatisfactory portmanteau term to cover all the younger sands and gravels of the Proto-Trent and Witham areas that are not otherwise named. Very little is known about these deposits so  more specific names have not yet ben applied. Younger parts include Witham gravels of local derivation and, mainly on Sheet 102, there are deposits that might represent southwards outflow from Lake Humber.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

The unit is referred to here as the Frog Hall Member as this is the name used in Bowen 1999. For consistency with other members in this part of the framework it should perhaps be Frog Hall Sand and Gravel Member. (B) The temperate ?Frog Member? (= Frog Hall Bed[s] of manuscripts) is included here in the Frog Hall [Sand and Gravel] Member, though Maddy had this as a member in its own right in Bowen (1999). (C) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene.@en;(a) This unit may be superfluous in the Avon scheme. (b) The &quot;terrace&quot; top and deposit base at the type locality lie within the 4th/Cropthorne envelope, suggesting the deposits should be classified as Cropthorne Member. Supposed MIS 7 organic deposits beneath it strengthen the case. (c) However, it has been mapped as Terrace 5/Pershore Member. It does indeed lie 6m or so above a nearby terrace outcrop mapped as Terrace 4/Cropthorne. If it were Pershore Member MIS 9 organics might be expected beneath it. &quot;Dating&quot; to MIS7, based solely on &quot;aminostratigraphy&quot;, could be wrong - apparently C fluminalis (to strengthen the Stage 7 case) has not been found. (d) Thus an extra Member is not needed: the unit should be reclassified as Cropthorne (ie BGS maps are wrong) or as Pershore Member. The former is most likely: probably it is a dissected remnant of a valley-side head fan, derived from Pershore gravels, but contemporaneous with the Cropthorne, and somewhat higher than the true Cropthorne terrace flat. Such fans extending uphill from the Cropthorne terrace are commonplace in the upper Avon. (d) Terrace surface at type locality c.40-42m OD, ie, c.30m above the modern Avon. (e) Upper boundary described as ?ground surface? but head might intervene.[Precis of notes from MGS]@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as Cropthorne Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Cropthorne Member. (B) Terrace surface typically some 11 to 15m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.25m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate.However, despite problems with lower terraces, it appears that the Cropthorne (Avon 4) meets the Kidderminster Station (Severn 4) fairly convincingly. (E) Accounts prior to Bowen (1999) include deposits now separated as the Strensham Member.@en;(A) Here named the Pershore Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999) and also in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is simply Pershore Member. (B) Terrace surface some 40m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain at type locality, where it includes the organic Allesborough Bed (the Pershore Fossil bed of Maddy et al., 1991) at base, which is assigned to MIS 9. Probably equates with Frog Hall Member of the upstream Avon/Leam, and with Bushley Green Member of the Severn Valley Formation. (C) Upper Boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) The Avon, and also Severn, terraces need reviewing in their entirety and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect, so the list of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. It is likely that some deposits classified as Pershore (Terrace 5) on existing maps are too low and should actually be classified as Cropthorne (4). That aside, despite some problems of correlation with other terraces, on the basis of elevation, it seems that the correspondence of the Pershore and Bushley Green members between the Avon and Severn, is fairly good.@en;(A) Here named the Wasperton Sand and Gravel though it is simply Wasperton Member in Bowen 1999, and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Dating of this terrace is contentious; as yet the crucial Fladbury Bed beneath it has no age-diagnostic fauna and its C14 date of c.38K (within MIS 3) may be a minimum. (C) Terrace surface typically some 5m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.9m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation. (G) Only 50K maps on the main course of the Avon are listed. Terrace 2 appears on several other maps in the catchment, up tributary steams and so on, (see Warwickshire Avon Valley Formation for complete list) but whether this is really the Wasperton Member is unclear.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the New Inn Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use it was simply New Inn Member. (B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Hence information relating to  Previous Names is necessarily an approximation.@en;(A) the unit is referred to here as Bretford Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Bretford Member. (B) Terrace surface is typically some 2m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain; locally with a lower facet c.1m above the floodplain, with deposits extending beneath the latter. Best developed in the upper Avon. Correlation with members of the Severn Valley Formation is problematical. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate. In particular the depiction of this Terrace 1 on maps, particularly in the lower Avon, is suspect. It is divided into 1a and 1b &quot;facets&quot;, which might be expected to converge with the Power House (Terrace 1) and Worcester (2) of the Severn, respectively. However the Power House, at least, is [supposedly] below the floodplain at the confluence, whereas patches of Avon Terrace 1, as far down as the confluence, lie 1 to 2m above. Actually depiction of the Severn Terraces might be wrong; some supposed Terrace 2 &quot;islands&quot; in the floodplain are almost certainly Terrace 1. Knock-on implications are that some of Terrace 3 should be 2, and so on.@en',FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

(B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area. (E) As this unit is not actually distinguished on any BGS maps (locally its component members are) the listing of 50K sheets is actually superfluous, but a list is included to show the areas where the Wolston Formation should encompass the glacial deposits.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/F,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/CurrentStatus/CURRENT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,WOLS@en,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,'English Midlands east of Birmingham, and as far south as the Moreton-in-Marsh and Tewkesbury areas.

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

(B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect.

The unit is referred to here as the Frog Hall Member as this is the name used in Bowen 1999. For consistency with other members in this part of the framework it should perhaps be Frog Hall Sand and Gravel Member. (B) The temperate ?Frog Member? (= Frog Hall Bed[s] of manuscripts) is included here in the Frog Hall [Sand and Gravel] Member, though Maddy had this as a member in its own right in Bowen (1999). (C) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene.@en;(a) This unit may be superfluous in the Avon scheme. (b) The &quot;terrace&quot; top and deposit base at the type locality lie within the 4th/Cropthorne envelope, suggesting the deposits should be classified as Cropthorne Member. Supposed MIS 7 organic deposits beneath it strengthen the case. (c) However, it has been mapped as Terrace 5/Pershore Member. It does indeed lie 6m or so above a nearby terrace outcrop mapped as Terrace 4/Cropthorne. If it were Pershore Member MIS 9 organics might be expected beneath it. &quot;Dating&quot; to MIS7, based solely on &quot;aminostratigraphy&quot;, could be wrong - apparently C fluminalis (to strengthen the Stage 7 case) has not been found. (d) Thus an extra Member is not needed: the unit should be reclassified as Cropthorne (ie BGS maps are wrong) or as Pershore Member. The former is most likely: probably it is a dissected remnant of a valley-side head fan, derived from Pershore gravels, but contemporaneous with the Cropthorne, and somewhat higher than the true Cropthorne terrace flat. Such fans extending uphill from the Cropthorne terrace are commonplace in the upper Avon. (d) Terrace surface at type locality c.40-42m OD, ie, c.30m above the modern Avon. (e) Upper boundary described as ?ground surface? but head might intervene.[Precis of notes from MGS]@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as Cropthorne Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Cropthorne Member. (B) Terrace surface typically some 11 to 15m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.25m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate.However, despite problems with lower terraces, it appears that the Cropthorne (Avon 4) meets the Kidderminster Station (Severn 4) fairly convincingly. (E) Accounts prior to Bowen (1999) include deposits now separated as the Strensham Member.@en;(A) Here named the Pershore Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999) and also in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is simply Pershore Member. (B) Terrace surface some 40m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain at type locality, where it includes the organic Allesborough Bed (the Pershore Fossil bed of Maddy et al., 1991) at base, which is assigned to MIS 9. Probably equates with Frog Hall Member of the upstream Avon/Leam, and with Bushley Green Member of the Severn Valley Formation. (C) Upper Boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) The Avon, and also Severn, terraces need reviewing in their entirety and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect, so the list of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. It is likely that some deposits classified as Pershore (Terrace 5) on existing maps are too low and should actually be classified as Cropthorne (4). That aside, despite some problems of correlation with other terraces, on the basis of elevation, it seems that the correspondence of the Pershore and Bushley Green members between the Avon and Severn, is fairly good.@en;(A) Here named the Wasperton Sand and Gravel though it is simply Wasperton Member in Bowen 1999, and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Dating of this terrace is contentious; as yet the crucial Fladbury Bed beneath it has no age-diagnostic fauna and its C14 date of c.38K (within MIS 3) may be a minimum. (C) Terrace surface typically some 5m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.9m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation. (G) Only 50K maps on the main course of the Avon are listed. Terrace 2 appears on several other maps in the catchment, up tributary steams and so on, (see Warwickshire Avon Valley Formation for complete list) but whether this is really the Wasperton Member is unclear.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the New Inn Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use it was simply New Inn Member. (B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Hence information relating to  Previous Names is necessarily an approximation.@en;(A) the unit is referred to here as Bretford Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Bretford Member. (B) Terrace surface is typically some 2m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain; locally with a lower facet c.1m above the floodplain, with deposits extending beneath the latter. Best developed in the upper Avon. Correlation with members of the Severn Valley Formation is problematical. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate. In particular the depiction of this Terrace 1 on maps, particularly in the lower Avon, is suspect. It is divided into 1a and 1b &quot;facets&quot;, which might be expected to converge with the Power House (Terrace 1) and Worcester (2) of the Severn, respectively. However the Power House, at least, is [supposedly] below the floodplain at the confluence, whereas patches of Avon Terrace 1, as far down as the confluence, lie 1 to 2m above. Actually depiction of the Severn Terraces might be wrong; some supposed Terrace 2 &quot;islands&quot; in the floodplain are almost certainly Terrace 1. Knock-on implications are that some of Terrace 3 should be 2, and so on.@en',FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

occur as fans, flat-topped plateaux, mounds, ridge systems and terraces.@en;Glaciolacustrine deposits infilling  basins and hollows associated with glaciofluvial outwash deposited during Late Devensian deglaciation.@en;Three types of landform are recognised associated with these deposits: Sinuous discontinous Esker ridges (single strand), typically  10-20m in height and up to c 1km in length. Elongated Mounds and hummocky topography with intervening poorly drained hollows (fluted kame and kettle topography). Flat-topped kame terraces standing up to 20m above the adajacent river floodplains, sandar plains, glaciofluvial fans and lower glaciofluial terraces flanking valleys infilled with Holocene fluvial and marine sediments. (All generally mapped as Glaciofluvial Sheet

West of the Lincoln Gap, correlated with the Holme Pierrepont Member (Trent Valley Formation); whilst east of Lincoln Gap also includes older materials correlated with the Scarle and Fulbeck Sand and Gravel members (Trent Valley Formation) and Castle Sand and Gravel Member (Bain Valley Formation).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Martin Terrace of the lower Witham valley. At surface, dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, etc. Terrace preserved as extensive dissected remnants at c.+18m in the Type Area, i.e about 16m above the Witham Floodplain there. Correlated with the Eagle Moor Sand and Gravel west of the Lincoln Gap.@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Scarle Terrace. Gravel dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, and rarer Triassic sandstone, Lias limestone, etc. Infills a shallow channel diverging from the Trent at Collingham and extending northnortheastwards to North Scarle where it is apparently truncated by the Kirkstead Sand and Gravel Member. Surface is c.3 to 4m above the Trent floodplain, and up to c.2m above the adjoining Kirkstead/Holme Pierrepont Terrace. Correlated with Beeston Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation), and Fulbeck Sand and Gravel Member (Proto-Trent).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Southrey Terrace. At surface, dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (c.60\%) with subordinate subangular flint, etc. (c.40\%). Terrace surface highly dissected but rises to c.6 to 7m above the Witham floodplain in the Type Area. Associated silts yielding a temperate flora and fauna occur at at least two sites; these might occur at the base of the unit but relationships are uncertain. Correlated with the Balderton Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation, west of the Lincoln Gap) and the Egginton Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en;Reddened sands and gravels dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint. Underlies possible terrace remnants adjacent to the outcrop of the Balderton Sand and Gravel and with a terrace surface standing typically c.4 to 5m above the Balderton Terrace. Upper part locally includes a thin fluvio-aeolian coversand (Whisby Sand Bed, pre-Ipswichian) and rubified palaeosol (Hykeham Soil; Ipswichian). Tentatively correlated with the Etwall Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en',symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;SYMB^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Unconformable,

This is probably largely MIS 4, but could extend into MIS 2 (and could therefore in part correlate with the Holme Pierepont Sand and Gravel of the Trent).@en;Upper Pleistocene to Holocene (MI Stage 2 to 1).@en;Upper Pleistocene (MI Stage 2).

definition compiler notes: At Newark itself this terrace seems to be at c.18m, which (depending upon how the profile is drawn) could read as only 7m above the Trent - hence previous confusion with the Beeston Terrace. However, the terrace here could be degraded in some way, because it is slightly higher than this &quot;downstream&quot;. If the profile is projected back towards Newark it &quot;ought&quot; to be 10 or 11m above the modern floodplain.@en;Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en;Partly because of misunderstandings about the age relationships, Howard (in Bowen, 1999) ascribed the downstream end of the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel (which would lie on Sheet 114) as a separate Bassingham Fen Member. The latter name is superfluous and is now subsumed into the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel.@en;As defined  this is a rather unsatisfactory portmanteau term to cover all the younger sands and gravels of the Proto-Trent and Witham areas that are not otherwise named. Very little is known about these deposits so  more specific names have not yet ben applied. Younger parts include Witham gravels of local derivation and, mainly on Sheet 102, there are deposits that might represent southwards outflow from Lake Humber.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

Well-defined palaeosol in upper part of gravelly deposits, overlain by silty fine sand of aeolian origin.@en;Encompasses fluvial, lacustrine and organic deposits of the pre-diversionary River Thames, and the pre-glacial soils developed on such deposits. Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The gravels are characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and by felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially-fractured sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and formations and members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel. The aggradations are generally entrenched into bedrock with a difference in surface elevation of at least 5m. The upper part of the gravels which dominate the subgroup are commonly affected by pedogenesis. The Valley Farm Soil is a rubified and clay-enriched horizon affecting the top 1.0-1.5m and indicating warm interglacial conditions. The Barham Arctic Structure Soil is a complex pedogenic horizon affecting the topmost 1.0-1.5m of the subgroup and of the Valley Farm Soil (Rose and Allen 1976, Rose et al 1985).@en;The formation encompasses the fluvial, lacustrine and organic deposits of the postulated &quot;Ancaster River&quot;, which is believed to have flowed from the Pennines to the North Sea along a line corresponding approximately to the present north coast of Norfolk.

Well-defined palaeosol in upper part of gravelly deposits, overlain by silty fine sand of aeolian origin.@en;Encompasses fluvial, lacustrine and organic deposits of the pre-diversionary River Thames, and the pre-glacial soils developed on such deposits. Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The gravels are characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and by felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially-fractured sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and formations and members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel. The aggradations are generally entrenched into bedrock with a difference in surface elevation of at least 5m. The upper part of the gravels which dominate the subgroup are commonly affected by pedogenesis. The Valley Farm Soil is a rubified and clay-enriched horizon affecting the top 1.0-1.5m and indicating warm interglacial conditions. The Barham Arctic Structure Soil is a complex pedogenic horizon affecting the topmost 1.0-1.5m of the subgroup and of the Valley Farm Soil (Rose and Allen 1976, Rose et al 1985).@en;The formation encompasses the fluvial, lacustrine and organic deposits of the postulated &quot;Ancaster River&quot;, which is believed to have flowed from the Pennines to the North Sea along a line corresponding approximately to the present north coast of Norfolk.

Correlated with the Borrowash Sand and Gravel Member (Derwent Valley Formation) and Burstall Sand and Gravel Member (Soar Valley Formation) and Balderton Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Eagle Moor Terrace. Dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint (typically 25\% in the Type Area), etc. Clayey and poorly sorted. In Type Area occurs as hill-top outliers falling from c.36m OD near Newark (c.25m above Trent floodplain) towards the Lincoln Gap, being at c.+32m OD at Eagle Moor and possibly descending more rapidly to the east. Outliers upstream in the Loughborough district 30m+ above Trent floodplain. Correlated with the Martin Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation), east of the Lincoln Gap.@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Etwall Terrace. Intensely cryoturbated, decalcified poorly sorted sand and gravel, dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (typically c.80\%) with subordinate subangular flint (up to c.20\%), Carboniferous chert, sandstone, etc. Fragmentary terrace surface appears to be c.20m above the Trent floodplain in the type area. The upper part locally includes a rubified palaeosol (Hykeham Soil; Ipswichian). The Member is correlated with the Ockbrook Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation) and Knighton Sand and Gravel Member (Soar Valley Formation).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Fulbeck Terrace. Typically a clean, well-sorted medium-grained sand with gravel that at depth is dominated by subangular and subrounded pebbles of Jurassic limestone (mainly Lias Group and Lincolnshire Limestone Formation), with a smaller proportion of other Jurassic lithologies, flint, &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite, etc, derived from older drift deposits. Commonly appears dominated by &quot;Bunter&quot; and flint pebbles near the surface due to decalcification. Infills a shallow channel partly coinciding with the valley of the modern River Brant, extending northnortheastwards from Woolsthorpe to Auborne. Terrace surface falls to c.6m OD at the northern end where the deposits are covered by Brant alluvium and probably are truncated by the deeper channel of the River Witham. Sections show cryogenic involutions and epigenetic ice wedge casts infilled with coversand. Basal part locally includes channel-filling organic silts (Little Syke Bed), which yield a temperate fauna and flora assigned to MIS 5e. Correlated with Beeston Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation), and Scarle Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en;Gravels, sands and loams that underlie the Hemington Terrace. Forms a terrace typically c.0.5 to 1m above the modern floodplain in the type area, and often distinguishable from the latter by the presence of mediaeval ridge and furrow. Generally comprises a lower unit of planar cross-bedded (laterally accreted, meandering river) gravel (up to 5m) and an upper unit of overbank silt (up to 2m); may also include organic muds in channels at the base. Gravel much as Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel, i.e. dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (c.80\%) with subordinate subangular flint, etc., but typically less sandy and orange-brown (not pinkish).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Holme Pierrepont Terrace. Generally pinkish, poorly sorted and compositionally rather immature matrix-supported, sandy, trough-cross bedded (braided river) gravels with syndepositional ice-wedge casts. Gravel dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (typically c.80\%), plus flint, Triassic and Upper Carboniferous sandstone, Lower Carboniferous cherts, etc, and other &quot;exotic&quot; lithogies. Forms a fairly well preserved terrace typically 1 to 2m above the floodplain in the upper and middle Trent, with the deposits extending beneath those of the younger Hemington Terrace and the floodplain alluvium.@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels representing the youngest deposits of the Proto-Trent, and the pre-Flandian deposits of the Witham. The former are typically dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, etc. but the latter have a greater proportion of flint and local Jurassic limestone, etc. Surface c.1 to 2m above the Trent floodplain, at Spalford, and typically 3 to 6m below Witham floodplain level in the Type Area. West of the Lincoln Gap, correlated with the Holme Pierrepont Member (Trent Valley Formation); whilst east of Lincoln Gap also includes older materials correlated with the Scarle and Fulbeck Sand and Gravel members (Trent Valley Formation) and Castle Sand and Gravel Member (Bain Valley Formation).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Martin Terrace of the lower Witham valley. At surface, dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, etc. Terrace preserved as extensive dissected remnants at c.+18m in the Type Area, i.e about 16m above the Witham Floodplain there. Correlated with the Eagle Moor Sand and Gravel west of the Lincoln Gap.@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Scarle Terrace. Gravel dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, and rarer Triassic sandstone, Lias limestone, etc. Infills a shallow channel diverging from the Trent at Collingham and extending northnortheastwards to North Scarle where it is apparently truncated by the Kirkstead Sand and Gravel Member. Surface is c.3 to 4m above the Trent floodplain, and up to c.2m above the adjoining Kirkstead/Holme Pierrepont Terrace. Correlated with Beeston Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation), and Fulbeck Sand and Gravel Member (Proto-Trent).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Southrey Terrace. At surface, dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (c.60\%) with subordinate subangular flint, etc. (c.40\%). Terrace surface highly dissected but rises to c.6 to 7m above the Witham floodplain in the Type Area. Associated silts yielding a temperate flora and fauna occur at at least two sites; these might occur at the base of the unit but relationships are uncertain. Correlated with the Balderton Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation, west of the Lincoln Gap) and the Egginton Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en;Reddened sands and gravels dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint. Underlies possible terrace remnants adjacent to the outcrop of the Balderton Sand and Gravel and with a terrace surface standing typically c.4 to 5m above the Balderton Terrace. Upper part locally includes a thin fluvio-aeolian coversand (Whisby Sand Bed, pre-Ipswichian) and rubified palaeosol (Hykeham Soil; Ipswichian). Tentatively correlated with the Etwall Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en',symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;SYMB^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;symb^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Unconformable,

definition compiler notes: At Newark itself this terrace seems to be at c.18m, which (depending upon how the profile is drawn) could read as only 7m above the Trent - hence previous confusion with the

However, the terrace here could be degraded in some way, because it is slightly higher than this &quot;downstream&quot;. If the profile is projected back towards Newark it &quot;ought&quot; to be 10 or 11m above the modern floodplain.@en;Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en;Partly because of misunderstandings about the age relationships, Howard (in Bowen, 1999) ascribed the downstream end of the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel (which would lie on Sheet 114) as a separate Bassingham Fen Member.

The complex includes fresh and brackish water peats, salt marsh clays, fluvial silts and fine-grained sands, marine sands, and beach-face sands and gravels. In centre of the Fen Basin, five stratigraphical units are present. In ascending order these are basal sand and gravel, the Fen Lower Peat, Barroway Drove Beds, Nordelph Peat and Terrington Beds. Barroway Drove Beds comprise intertidal soft grey clays and silty clays cut by tidal channels and creeks infilled with silt and fine-grained sand. Terrington Beds comprise marine and brackish water silts and fine-grained sands. Marine sands and gravels marginal to the Fen Basin are the Woodstone Member (silty clays and fine sands), the March Gravel Member (sandy gravel to clayey pebbly sand) and the Abbey Sand and Gravel Member (clayey, sandy gravels).@en;Clay, silt and sand with sporadic dropstones.

More detail of the lithologies of the individual members is included in the related Lexicon entries.@en;The Clyde Clay Formation has six members, from oldest to youngest - the Bridgeton Sand consists of beds of fine- to medium-grained sand, and sandy fine to coarse gravel in an upward-fining succession. The Paisley Clay consists of clays and silts, finely colour banded in shades of greyish brown, grey and reddish brown. The Linwood Clay consists of thickly bedded to massive silts, clayey silts and silty clays, medium to dark grey becoming brownish grey downwards, with sand layers, black sulphide bands and many marine shells. The Killearn Sand and Gravel is commonly reddish brown and yellow, fine- to medium-grained sand with clay layers and beds of gravel. The Inverleven Gravel typically is angular to subrounded boulders, cobbles and gravel in a clayey sand matrix with barnacles. The Balloch Clay consists of clayey silt, silt, clay and sand, mid to dark grey, brownish grey and locally reddish brown, bedded and thinly laminated, normal and reverse graded units, with dark sulphide patches and rare marine shells. Their stratigraphical relationships and geographical distribution are summarized in Browne and McMillan, 1989a, Figures 2b, c and d, 3A, B, C and D and 4A, B and C.)@en;This formation, which underlies much of the marshland in the Great Yarmouth district, is dominated by unconsolidated silt and clay with a shelly marine fauna. Sand is generally a minor component, though locally substantial sand bodies interrupt the argillaceous succession. Peat, of freshwater and brackish origins, is a major component adjacent to much of the marshland margin and particularly in the valleys of the River Yare and tributary streams. If also occurs as three widespread though locally inpersistent layers, at the base of the formation, within it, and at the top, mainly in the marshalnd fringe.@en;Sands and gravels. The sands are fine-grained and quartzose, with beds of comminuted shell. The gravels, which are composed of Chalk flint, quartz, sandstone, cherts, rounded lumps of red, green and grey Triassic mudstones and Liassic fossils, are marine in origin with a few interbedded palaeosols and freshwater sands. They contain fossilised marine, fresh water and terrestrial shells and remains of elephant, rhinoceras, horse, auroch, red, fallow and roe deer, hyaena and wolf. The marine shells indicate both cold and warm water climates and sandy, muddy and rocky habitat, and the freshwater shell Corbicula fluminalis indicates a climate warmer than now. The deposits form low mounds protruding through the surface of the Holocene silts and clays of the Somerset Levels Formation.@en;Clayey silt and clay, commonly rooty and structureless; also highly laminated with silt and very fine- to medium-, locally coarse-grained sand with pebbles up to 5mm and fragments of vivianite; grey and brownish grey, finely micaceous, dark sulphidic patches.

The subgroup is currently divided into the Upper Thames Valley Formation and the Maidenhead Formation (middle and lower Thames valley) for deposits of the main valley and some tributary valleys. The Kennet Valley Formation is established to terrace deposits of that valley. Terrace deposit gravel clasts are mainly limetone lithogies (upper Thames) and flint, vein quartz and local bedrock lithologies including chert (middle and lower Thames).

(B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en','Ground surface.@en',NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/M,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,'Wolvercote Sand And Gravel Member@en','0 to c,3m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_48752;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_49677;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50263;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50264;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50265;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50631;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50680;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50874;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50918;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50985;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51002;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51363;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51515;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51838;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51966;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_52086;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_52112;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_52988;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_53046,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,WV@en,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Wolvercote Sand And Gravel Member@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/onshoreOffshore/ONSHORE,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4171;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4173;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4662;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4663;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4168;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4660;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4661,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Predominantly cold phase sands and gravels that underlie the Wolvercote or Third Terrace of BGS maps.

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

definition compiler notes: At Newark itself this terrace seems to be at c.18m, which (depending upon how the profile is drawn) could read as only 7m above the Trent - hence previous confusion with the Beeston Terrace. However, the terrace here could be degraded in some way, because it is slightly higher than this &quot;downstream&quot;. If the profile is projected back towards Newark it &quot;ought&quot; to be 10 or 11m above the modern floodplain.@en;Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en;Partly because of misunderstandings about the age relationships, Howard (in Bowen, 1999) ascribed the downstream end of the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel (which would lie on Sheet 114) as a separate Bassingham Fen Member. The latter name is superfluous and is now subsumed into the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel.@en;As defined  this is a rather unsatisfactory portmanteau term to cover all the younger sands and gravels of the Proto-Trent and Witham areas that are not otherwise named. Very little is known about these deposits so  more specific names have not yet ben applied. Younger parts include Witham gravels of local derivation and, mainly on Sheet 102, there are deposits that might represent southwards outflow from Lake Humber.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

(B) Terrace surface some 55m above modern Severn alluvial floodplain in the Worcester area, descending to about 45m downstream, at type locality, in the southern part of Sheet 216. Probably represents downstream equivalent of the Dunsmore Gravel Member of the Wolston Formation, ie. Anglian outwash terrace (and younger than the Woolridge Gravel Member, which occurs in the lower Severn valley). (C) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) Severn terraces, particularly the older ones, need reviewing and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect ? hence the section of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. The Spring Hill as such was not recognised prior to BGS work on sheet 216, although some outcrops of ?Sixth Terrace?, which (mostly) seem to be Spring Hill, were mapped on Sheet 182. On Sheet 234 some high gravels are classified as Wills? Woolridge Terrace, which is now (as Woolridge Member) included in the Wolston Formation (outwash gravels) but some look more likely to be Spring Hill on the basis of elevation. (E) According to the compiler?s favoured scheme for a two-phase Anglian (believed to be the only one that fits the evidence, despite the so-far missing stage 11 interglacial) the Spring Hill is Stage 10 distal outwash and the Woolridge Stage 12, probably more proximal, outwash.

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

The complex includes fresh and brackish water peats, salt marsh clays, fluvial silts and fine-grained sands, marine sands, and beach-face sands and gravels. In centre of the Fen Basin, five stratigraphical units are present. In ascending order these are basal sand and gravel, the Fen Lower Peat, Barroway Drove Beds, Nordelph Peat and Terrington Beds. Barroway Drove Beds comprise intertidal soft grey clays and silty clays cut by tidal channels and creeks infilled with silt and fine-grained sand. Terrington Beds comprise marine and brackish water silts and fine-grained sands. Marine sands and gravels marginal to the Fen Basin are the Woodstone Member (silty clays and fine sands), the March Gravel Member (sandy gravel to clayey pebbly sand) and the Abbey Sand and Gravel Member (clayey, sandy gravels).@en;Clay, silt and sand with sporadic dropstones.

More detail of the lithologies of the individual members is included in the related Lexicon entries.@en;The Clyde Clay Formation has six members, from oldest to youngest - the Bridgeton Sand consists of beds of fine- to medium-grained sand, and sandy fine to coarse gravel in an upward-fining succession. The Paisley Clay consists of clays and silts, finely colour banded in shades of greyish brown, grey and reddish brown. The Linwood Clay consists of thickly bedded to massive silts, clayey silts and silty clays, medium to dark grey becoming brownish grey downwards, with sand layers, black sulphide bands and many marine shells. The Killearn Sand and Gravel is commonly reddish brown and yellow, fine- to medium-grained sand with clay layers and beds of gravel. The Inverleven Gravel typically is angular to subrounded boulders, cobbles and gravel in a clayey sand matrix with barnacles. The Balloch Clay consists of clayey silt, silt, clay and sand, mid to dark grey, brownish grey and locally reddish brown, bedded and thinly laminated, normal and reverse graded units, with dark sulphide patches and rare marine shells. Their stratigraphical relationships and geographical distribution are summarized in Browne and McMillan, 1989a, Figures 2b, c and d, 3A, B, C and D and 4A, B and C.)@en;This formation, which underlies much of the marshland in the Great Yarmouth district, is dominated by unconsolidated silt and clay with a shelly marine fauna. Sand is generally a minor component, though locally substantial sand bodies interrupt the argillaceous succession. Peat, of freshwater and brackish origins, is a major component adjacent to much of the marshland margin and particularly in the valleys of the River Yare and tributary streams. If also occurs as three widespread though locally inpersistent layers, at the base of the formation, within it, and at the top, mainly in the marshalnd fringe.@en;Sands and gravels. The sands are fine-grained and quartzose, with beds of comminuted shell. The gravels, which are composed of Chalk flint, quartz, sandstone, cherts, rounded lumps of red, green and grey Triassic mudstones and Liassic fossils, are marine in origin with a few interbedded palaeosols and freshwater sands. They contain fossilised marine, fresh water and terrestrial shells and remains of elephant, rhinoceras, horse, auroch, red, fallow and roe deer, hyaena and wolf. The marine shells indicate both cold and warm water climates and sandy, muddy and rocky habitat, and the freshwater shell Corbicula fluminalis indicates a climate warmer than now. The deposits form low mounds protruding through the surface of the Holocene silts and clays of the Somerset Levels Formation.@en;Clayey silt and clay, commonly rooty and structureless; also highly laminated with silt and very fine- to medium-, locally coarse-grained sand with pebbles up to 5mm and fragments of vivianite; grey and brownish grey, finely micaceous, dark sulphidic patches.

(C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area.

(B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area. (E) As this unit is not actually distinguished on any BGS maps (locally its component members are) the listing of 50K sheets is actually superfluous, but a list is included to show the areas where the Wolston Formation should encompass the glacial deposits.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/F,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/CurrentStatus/CURRENT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,WOLS@en,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,'English Midlands east of Birmingham, and as far south as the Moreton-in-Marsh and Tewkesbury areas.

Deposits of four separate river terrace levels are recognised as members of the Ingham Formation. Commonly a basal sandy gravel is overlain by pebbly sands, with few clay and silt beds.

Sedimentary structures indicate deposition by braided rivers.@en;Unbedded and thickly bedded cobble gravel with interbedded coarse sands. Gravels are dominantly nodular flint to 0.2m diameter, with subordinate quartz and Greensand chert. The sand is subangular, dominantly quartz with some flint, and occurs as horizontal planar-bedded units, cross-bedded lenses, and channel-fill sands and silts.

Well-defined palaeosol in upper part of gravelly deposits, overlain by silty fine sand of aeolian origin.@en;Encompasses fluvial, lacustrine and organic deposits of the pre-diversionary River Thames, and the pre-glacial soils developed on such deposits. Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The gravels are characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and by felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially-fractured sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and formations and members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel. The aggradations are generally entrenched into bedrock with a difference in surface elevation of at least 5m. The upper part of the gravels which dominate the subgroup are commonly affected by pedogenesis. The Valley Farm Soil is a rubified and clay-enriched horizon affecting the top 1.0-1.5m and indicating warm interglacial conditions. The Barham Arctic Structure Soil is a complex pedogenic horizon affecting the topmost 1.0-1.5m of the subgroup and of the Valley Farm Soil (Rose and Allen 1976, Rose et al 1985).@en;The formation encompasses the fluvial, lacustrine and organic deposits of the postulated &quot;Ancaster River&quot;, which is believed to have flowed from the Pennines to the North Sea along a line corresponding approximately to the present north coast of Norfolk.

(B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area.

occur as fans, flat-topped plateaux, mounds, ridge systems and terraces.@en;Glaciolacustrine deposits infilling  basins and hollows associated with glaciofluvial outwash deposited during Late Devensian deglaciation.@en;Three types of landform are recognised associated with these deposits: Sinuous discontinous Esker ridges (single strand), typically  10-20m in height and up to c 1km in length. Elongated Mounds and hummocky topography with intervening poorly drained hollows (fluted kame and kettle topography). Flat-topped kame terraces standing up to 20m above the adajacent river floodplains, sandar plains, glaciofluvial fans and lower glaciofluial terraces flanking valleys infilled with Holocene fluvial and marine sediments.

Colour and dominant clast composition variable and generally reflect the local bedrock geology; in the Cheshire-Shropshire Plain the diamicton is red and red-brown and sparsely pebbly (see Thomas, 1985, p.322); in Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire it is generally green-grey with abundant Lower Palaeozoic rock clasts.@en;Sand and gravel, typically reddish brown and silty, containing clasts of red sandstone, greywacke sandstone and siltstone, and grey granodiorite.@en;Stratigraphically complex glacigenic sequence of local provenance, including laminated and massive muds with dropstones, interstratified gravel sand and mud, and muddy diamicton.@en;Sand and gravel, with cobbles and pebbles predominantly of Permo-Triassic sandstone and Lower Palaeozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks in a matrix of medium- to coarse-grained sand; typically pale yellow to reddish brown. Greywacke and granitic clasts are common in subordinate amounts. Esker deposits are typically poorly sorted, cobbly and bouldery, well-bedded with high-angle cross-bedding. Some interbeds of coarse sand. Fluted kame and kettle deposits are typically moderately sorted, thickly bedded, cobbly, commonly in upward-fining steeply tabular cross-bedded or trough cross-bedded units. Glaciofluvial Sheet deposits are typically thickly bedded well-sorted gravels, with interbeds of coarse- to medium-grained sand. Commonly horizontally bedded, but tabular high-angle cross-bedded units common. The upper surface is commonly involuted and beds of laminated and rippled sandy silt and clay with dropstone cobbles are present locally, indicating the presence of temporary glacial lakes.@en;Interbedded diamicton, boulder gravel, sand, silt and clay. Typically reddish brown with clasts of red sandstone dominant, but locally yellowish brown with clasts of yellow sandstone dominant.@en;A glacigenic sequence of till (sandy, gravelly clay with cobbles and boulders) and laminated silt and clay separated by variably continuous lenses or beds of sand and gravel. Erratics are dominated by Carboniferous rocks and Lake District and Irish Sea derived bedrock. Correlated with the Stockport Glacigenic Formation of Cheshire (Worsley, 1991).@en;Glacially technically deformed complex sequence of diamictons, gravels and shelly sands. It is dominated by material derived from offshore within the Irish Sea basin, and the Formation includes rafts of marine sediment.@en;A mixed glacigenic sequence of till (sandy, gravelly clay with cobbles and boulders), sand, gravel and laminated clay and silt. Erratics are dominated by Lake District (Borrowdale Volcanic rocks and Eskdale Granite), and Carboniferous derived rock fragments but include Irish Sea derived material in places.@en;Brown and grey clay and silt laminated clay, with interbeds of grey/yellow stratified silt and fine sand, which locally increases in abundance towards the top. Dropstones are locally abundant and form thin beds of diamicton. Clasts are dominated by local bedrock lithologies but characteristically include shell fragments.@en',AIK^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;SEA^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;Bw^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;CBF^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;G^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;CS^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;Gc^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;GE^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;GY^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;PSG^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode;KER^^http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/MapCode,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Sharp, undulating, unconformable contact with pale red stony clay diamicton and cobble gravel of the HolmrookTill Member of the Blengdale Glacigenic Formation.@en;Sharp, unconformable contact with fluviatile gravel (Four Ashes Sand and Gravel Formation) containing mainly well rounded clasts derived from the Kidderminster Formation (Bunter Pebble Beds) conglomerates and numerous organic-rich lenses of Ipswichian to Middle Devensian age.

occur as fans, flat-topped plateaux, mounds, ridge systems and terraces.@en;Glaciolacustrine deposits infilling  basins and hollows associated with glaciofluvial outwash deposited during Late Devensian deglaciation.@en;Three types of landform are recognised associated with these deposits: Sinuous discontinous Esker ridges (single strand), typically  10-20m in height and up to c 1km in length. Elongated Mounds and hummocky topography with intervening poorly drained hollows (fluted kame and kettle topography). Flat-topped kame terraces standing up to 20m above the adajacent river floodplains, sandar plains, glaciofluvial fans and lower glaciofluial terraces flanking valleys infilled with Holocene fluvial and marine sediments.

(B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation.

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

The name follows Bowen et al (1999) and BGS provisional Framework document. (B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area. (E) As this unit is not actually distinguished on any BGS maps (locally its component members are) the listing of 50K sheets is actually superfluous, but a list is included to show the areas where the Wolston Formation should encompass the glacial deposits.@en;(A) Name follows Bowen et al. (1999) and the provisional BGS Framework, but should it be Nurseries Glacigenic Formation? (B) There is little dispute about its Stage 12 Anglian age. That it lies below ?Hoxnian? organics is an important part of the argument for two pre-Late Devensian glaciations - see also comments on Ridgacre Formation - but this is largely dependent on the exact age of the organics, which is still contentious. (C) By definition this is the older of the two pre-Devensian glacial successions identified in the Birmingham area. It was separated by Kelly in his sections of M-way boreholes, which suggest it is quite extensive beneath the Ridgacre in north Birmingham. Neither he nor Horton give sufficient data to characterise it fully lithologically so it is not possible to state the full range of lithology nor its lateral extent. Survey of the Birmingham district (Powell et al, 2000) threw no further light on the problem, except that most of the tills are described as reddish and Trias-rich, which sounds more like the younger Ridgeacre Formation. (D) Glacigenic deposits are widespread beyond the Devensian limit in the Midlands but they have not been separated into two phases (except perhaps where stratigraphy is clear in the Wolston Formation). If there is a southern or eastern limit to the Ridgacre within the area (see Maddy et al., 1995) and the Nurseries Formation extends beyond it, it would mean that the latter is widespread at surface and constitutes much of the western older drift to the west of obvious northern and eastern Wolston Formation. Much more work is needed. (E) This unit is not yet distinguished on any maps, so the information related to 50K maps indicates where the Nurseries Formation (and/or Ridgacre) might occur.@en;(A) As in Bowen et al (1999) and new BGS scheme. Should it be Ridgacre Glacigenic Formation? (B) Age left vague. Overlying ?Hoxnian? organics it is part of support for two pre-Late Devensian glaciations. Those envisaging a 2-phase Anglian put the unit in MIS 10, with the Oadby Till. Others put it in 6, based on relationship with Severn terraces, mirroring arguments based on the Avon/Severn/Thames that imply a Stage 10 Oadby Till (+ Ridgacre)! Avon/Severn relationships must be sorted out. Ridgacre at Quinton and Nechells could be Upper Pleistocene 4, or even 12, as the ?Hoxnian? beds age is uncertain. (C) This is the younger of two pre-Devensian glacial sequences at Quinton and Nechells. Not separated by BGS but Kelly?s (1964) sections suggest Ridgacre must be widespread, at least in north Birmingham. Neither Kelly nor Horton give enough lithological data to characterize the unit fully. Until lateral extent is known, full range of lithologies is unknown; a Catch 22! (D) Widespread glacigenic deposits beyond Devensian limit in the Midlands are not separated into two phases (except in Wolston Formation). As representing the later episode it might be safe to say most pre-Devensian glacial deposits on Birmingham area maps are Ridgacre, and that Nurseries might be limited to buried pockets, as at Quinton and Nechells. Birmingham area survey (Powell et al, 2000), shed little light ? most tills reddish and Trias rich, more like Ridgeacre than Nurseries. Ridgacre?s southern limit could be within the area and Nurseries extend beyond, with both at outcrop. Other problems are deciding Ridgacre?s eastern limit, where it becomes part of Wolston Formation, and how far north it goes.

Deposits of four separate river terrace levels are recognised as members of the Ingham Formation. Commonly a basal sandy gravel is overlain by pebbly sands, with few clay and silt beds.

Sedimentary structures indicate deposition by braided rivers.@en;Unbedded and thickly bedded cobble gravel with interbedded coarse sands. Gravels are dominantly nodular flint to 0.2m diameter, with subordinate quartz and Greensand chert. The sand is subangular, dominantly quartz with some flint, and occurs as horizontal planar-bedded units, cross-bedded lenses, and channel-fill sands and silts.

Well-defined palaeosol in upper part of gravelly deposits, overlain by silty fine sand of aeolian origin.@en;Encompasses fluvial, lacustrine and organic deposits of the pre-diversionary River Thames, and the pre-glacial soils developed on such deposits. Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The gravels are characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and by felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially-fractured sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and formations and members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel. The aggradations are generally entrenched into bedrock with a difference in surface elevation of at least 5m. The upper part of the gravels which dominate the subgroup are commonly affected by pedogenesis. The Valley Farm Soil is a rubified and clay-enriched horizon affecting the top 1.0-1.5m and indicating warm interglacial conditions. The Barham Arctic Structure Soil is a complex pedogenic horizon affecting the topmost 1.0-1.5m of the subgroup and of the Valley Farm Soil (Rose and Allen 1976, Rose et al 1985).@en;The formation encompasses the fluvial, lacustrine and organic deposits of the postulated &quot;Ancaster River&quot;, which is believed to have flowed from the Pennines to the North Sea along a line corresponding approximately to the present north coast of Norfolk.

(= Frog Hall Bed[s] of manuscripts) is included here in the Frog Hall [Sand and Gravel] Member, though Maddy had this as a member in its own right in Bowen (1999). (C) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene.@en;(a) This unit may be superfluous in the Avon scheme. (b) The &quot;terrace&quot; top and deposit base at the type locality lie within the 4th/Cropthorne envelope, suggesting the deposits should be classified as Cropthorne Member. Supposed MIS 7 organic deposits beneath it strengthen the case. (c) However, it has been mapped as Terrace 5/Pershore Member. It does indeed lie 6m or so above a nearby terrace outcrop mapped as Terrace 4/Cropthorne. If it were Pershore Member MIS 9 organics might be expected beneath it. &quot;Dating&quot; to MIS7, based solely on &quot;aminostratigraphy&quot;, could be wrong - apparently C fluminalis (to strengthen the Stage 7 case) has not been found. (d) Thus an extra Member is not needed: the unit should be reclassified as Cropthorne (ie BGS maps are wrong) or as Pershore Member. The former is most likely: probably it is a dissected remnant of a valley-side head fan, derived from Pershore gravels, but contemporaneous with the Cropthorne, and somewhat higher than the true Cropthorne terrace flat. Such fans extending uphill from the Cropthorne terrace are commonplace in the upper Avon. (d) Terrace surface at type locality c.40-42m OD, ie, c.30m above the modern Avon. (e) Upper boundary described as ?ground surface? but head might intervene.[Precis of notes from MGS]@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as Cropthorne Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Cropthorne Member. (B) Terrace surface typically some 11 to 15m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.25m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate.However, despite problems with lower terraces, it appears that the Cropthorne (Avon 4) meets the Kidderminster Station (Severn 4) fairly convincingly. (E) Accounts prior to Bowen (1999) include deposits now separated as the Strensham Member.@en;(A) Here named the Pershore Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999) and also in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is simply Pershore Member. (B) Terrace surface some 40m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain at type locality, where it includes the organic Allesborough Bed (the Pershore Fossil bed of Maddy et al., 1991) at base, which is assigned to MIS 9. Probably equates with Frog Hall Member of the upstream Avon/Leam, and with Bushley Green Member of the Severn Valley Formation. (C) Upper Boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) The Avon, and also Severn, terraces need reviewing in their entirety and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect, so the list of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. It is likely that some deposits classified as Pershore (Terrace 5) on existing maps are too low and should actually be classified as Cropthorne (4). That aside, despite some problems of correlation with other terraces, on the basis of elevation, it seems that the correspondence of the Pershore and Bushley Green members between the Avon and Severn, is fairly good.@en;(A) Here named the Wasperton Sand and Gravel though it is simply Wasperton Member in Bowen 1999, and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Dating of this terrace is contentious; as yet the crucial Fladbury Bed beneath it has no age-diagnostic fauna and its C14 date of c.38K (within MIS 3) may be a minimum. (C) Terrace surface typically some 5m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.9m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation. (G) Only 50K maps on the main course of the Avon are listed. Terrace 2 appears on several other maps in the catchment, up tributary steams and so on, (see Warwickshire Avon Valley Formation for complete list) but whether this is really the Wasperton Member is unclear.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the New Inn Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use it was simply New Inn Member. (B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Hence information relating to  Previous Names is necessarily an approximation.@en;(A) the unit is referred to here as Bretford Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Bretford Member. (B) Terrace surface is typically some 2m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain; locally with a lower facet c.1m above the floodplain, with deposits extending beneath the latter. Best developed in the upper Avon. Correlation with members of the Severn Valley Formation is problematical. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate. In particular the depiction of this Terrace 1 on maps, particularly in the lower Avon, is suspect. It is divided into 1a and 1b &quot;facets&quot;, which might be expected to converge with the Power House (Terrace 1) and Worcester (2) of the Severn, respectively. However the Power House, at least, is [supposedly] below the floodplain at the confluence, whereas patches of Avon Terrace 1, as far down as the confluence, lie 1 to 2m above. Actually depiction of the Severn Terraces might be wrong; some supposed Terrace 2 &quot;islands&quot; in the floodplain are almost certainly Terrace 1. Knock-on implications are that some of Terrace 3 should be 2, and so on.@en',FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

previously considered a river terrace deposit of the Severn and its tributaries in the West Midlands, Maddy (1997) has defined this as a Late Wolstonian glaciofluvial  outwash deposit.@en;(A) Now named the Spring Hill Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999 and also the BGS computer codes list have Spring Hill Member. (B) Terrace surface some 55m above modern Severn alluvial floodplain in the Worcester area, descending to about 45m downstream, at type locality, in the southern part of Sheet 216. Probably represents downstream equivalent of the Dunsmore Gravel Member of the Wolston Formation, ie. Anglian outwash terrace (and younger than the Woolridge Gravel Member, which occurs in the lower Severn valley). (C) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) Severn terraces, particularly the older ones, need reviewing and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect ? hence the section of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. The Spring Hill as such was not recognised prior to BGS work on sheet 216, although some outcrops of ?Sixth Terrace?, which (mostly) seem to be Spring Hill, were mapped on Sheet 182. On Sheet 234 some high gravels are classified as Wills? Woolridge Terrace, which is now (as Woolridge Member) included in the Wolston Formation (outwash gravels) but some look more likely to be Spring Hill on the basis of elevation. (E) According to the compiler?s favoured scheme for a two-phase Anglian (believed to be the only one that fits the evidence, despite the so-far missing stage 11 interglacial) the Spring Hill is Stage 10 distal outwash and the Woolridge Stage 12, probably more proximal, outwash. This accords with the ages assigned in Bowen (1999).@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

named the Spring Hill Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999 and also the BGS computer codes list have Spring Hill Member. (B) Terrace surface some 55m above modern Severn alluvial floodplain in the Worcester area, descending to about 45m downstream, at type locality, in the southern part of Sheet 216. Probably represents downstream equivalent of the Dunsmore Gravel Member of the Wolston Formation, ie. Anglian outwash terrace (and younger than the Woolridge Gravel Member, which occurs in the lower Severn valley). (C) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) Severn terraces, particularly the older ones, need reviewing and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect ? hence the section of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. The Spring Hill as such was not recognised prior to BGS work on sheet 216, although some outcrops of ?Sixth Terrace?, which (mostly) seem to be Spring Hill, were mapped on Sheet 182. On Sheet 234 some high gravels are classified as Wills? Woolridge Terrace, which is now (as Woolridge Member) included in the Wolston Formation (outwash gravels) but some look more likely to be Spring Hill on the basis of elevation. (E) According to the compiler?s favoured scheme for a two-phase Anglian (believed to be the only one that fits the evidence, despite the so-far missing stage 11 interglacial) the Spring Hill is Stage 10 distal outwash and the Woolridge Stage 12, probably more proximal, outwash. This accords with the ages assigned in Bowen (1999).@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area.

(B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area. (E) As this unit is not actually distinguished on any BGS maps (locally its component members are) the listing of 50K sheets is actually superfluous, but a list is included to show the areas where the Wolston Formation should encompass the glacial deposits.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/F,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/CurrentStatus/CURRENT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,WOLS@en,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,'English Midlands east of Birmingham, and as far south as the Moreton-in-Marsh and Tewkesbury areas.

(B) Terrace surface some 55m above modern Severn alluvial floodplain in the Worcester area, descending to about 45m downstream, at type locality, in the southern part of Sheet 216. Probably represents downstream equivalent of the Dunsmore Gravel Member of the Wolston Formation, ie. Anglian outwash terrace (and younger than the Woolridge Gravel Member, which occurs in the lower Severn valley). (C) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) Severn terraces, particularly the older ones, need reviewing and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect ? hence the section of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. The Spring Hill as such was not recognised prior to BGS work on sheet 216, although some outcrops of ?Sixth Terrace?, which (mostly) seem to be Spring Hill, were mapped on Sheet 182. On Sheet 234 some high gravels are classified as Wills? Woolridge Terrace, which is now (as Woolridge Member) included in the Wolston Formation (outwash gravels) but some look more likely to be Spring Hill on the basis of elevation. (E) According to the compiler?s favoured scheme for a two-phase Anglian (believed to be the only one that fits the evidence, despite the so-far missing stage 11 interglacial) the Spring Hill is Stage 10 distal outwash and the Woolridge Stage 12, probably more proximal, outwash.

previously considered a river terrace deposit of the Severn and its tributaries in the West Midlands, Maddy (1997) has defined this as a Late Wolstonian glaciofluvial  outwash deposit.@en;Though previously considered a river terrace deposit of the Severn and its tributaries in the West Midlands, Maddy (1997) has defined this as a Late Wolstonian glaciofluvial  outwash deposit.@en;(A) Now named the Spring Hill Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999 and also the BGS computer codes list have Spring Hill Member. (B) Terrace surface some 55m above modern Severn alluvial floodplain in the Worcester area, descending to about 45m downstream, at type locality, in the southern part of Sheet 216. Probably represents downstream equivalent of the Dunsmore Gravel Member of the Wolston Formation, ie. Anglian outwash terrace (and younger than the Woolridge Gravel Member, which occurs in the lower Severn valley). (C) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) Severn terraces, particularly the older ones, need reviewing and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect ? hence the section of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. The Spring Hill as such was not recognised prior to BGS work on sheet 216, although some outcrops of ?Sixth Terrace?, which (mostly) seem to be Spring Hill, were mapped on Sheet 182. On Sheet 234 some high gravels are classified as Wills? Woolridge Terrace, which is now (as Woolridge Member) included in the Wolston Formation (outwash gravels) but some look more likely to be Spring Hill on the basis of elevation. (E) According to the compiler?s favoured scheme for a two-phase Anglian (believed to be the only one that fits the evidence, despite the so-far missing stage 11 interglacial) the Spring Hill is Stage 10 distal outwash and the Woolridge Stage 12, probably more proximal, outwash. This accords with the ages assigned in Bowen (1999).@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

The unit is referred to here as the Frog Hall Member as this is the name used in Bowen 1999. For consistency with other members in this part of the framework it should perhaps be Frog Hall Sand and Gravel Member. (B) The temperate ?Frog Member? (= Frog Hall Bed[s] of manuscripts) is included here in the Frog Hall [Sand and Gravel] Member, though Maddy had this as a member in its own right in Bowen (1999). (C) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene.@en;(a) This unit may be superfluous in the Avon scheme. (b) The &quot;terrace&quot; top and deposit base at the type locality lie within the 4th/Cropthorne envelope, suggesting the deposits should be classified as Cropthorne Member. Supposed MIS 7 organic deposits beneath it strengthen the case. (c) However, it has been mapped as Terrace 5/Pershore Member. It does indeed lie 6m or so above a nearby terrace outcrop mapped as Terrace 4/Cropthorne. If it were Pershore Member MIS 9 organics might be expected beneath it. &quot;Dating&quot; to MIS7, based solely on &quot;aminostratigraphy&quot;, could be wrong - apparently C fluminalis (to strengthen the Stage 7 case) has not been found. (d) Thus an extra Member is not needed: the unit should be reclassified as Cropthorne (ie BGS maps are wrong) or as Pershore Member. The former is most likely: probably it is a dissected remnant of a valley-side head fan, derived from Pershore gravels, but contemporaneous with the Cropthorne, and somewhat higher than the true Cropthorne terrace flat. Such fans extending uphill from the Cropthorne terrace are commonplace in the upper Avon. (d) Terrace surface at type locality c.40-42m OD, ie, c.30m above the modern Avon. (e) Upper boundary described as ?ground surface? but head might intervene.[Precis of notes from MGS]@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as Cropthorne Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Cropthorne Member. (B) Terrace surface typically some 11 to 15m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.25m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate.However, despite problems with lower terraces, it appears that the Cropthorne (Avon 4) meets the Kidderminster Station (Severn 4) fairly convincingly. (E) Accounts prior to Bowen (1999) include deposits now separated as the Strensham Member.@en;(A) Here named the Pershore Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999) and also in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is simply Pershore Member. (B) Terrace surface some 40m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain at type locality, where it includes the organic Allesborough Bed (the Pershore Fossil bed of Maddy et al., 1991) at base, which is assigned to MIS 9. Probably equates with Frog Hall Member of the upstream Avon/Leam, and with Bushley Green Member of the Severn Valley Formation. (C) Upper Boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) The Avon, and also Severn, terraces need reviewing in their entirety and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect, so the list of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. It is likely that some deposits classified as Pershore (Terrace 5) on existing maps are too low and should actually be classified as Cropthorne (4). That aside, despite some problems of correlation with other terraces, on the basis of elevation, it seems that the correspondence of the Pershore and Bushley Green members between the Avon and Severn, is fairly good.@en;(A) Here named the Wasperton Sand and Gravel though it is simply Wasperton Member in Bowen 1999, and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Dating of this terrace is contentious; as yet the crucial Fladbury Bed beneath it has no age-diagnostic fauna and its C14 date of c.38K (within MIS 3) may be a minimum. (C) Terrace surface typically some 5m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.9m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation. (G) Only 50K maps on the main course of the Avon are listed. Terrace 2 appears on several other maps in the catchment, up tributary steams and so on, (see Warwickshire Avon Valley Formation for complete list) but whether this is really the Wasperton Member is unclear.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the New Inn Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use it was simply New Inn Member. (B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Hence information relating to  Previous Names is necessarily an approximation.@en;(A) the unit is referred to here as Bretford Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Bretford Member. (B) Terrace surface is typically some 2m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain; locally with a lower facet c.1m above the floodplain, with deposits extending beneath the latter. Best developed in the upper Avon. Correlation with members of the Severn Valley Formation is problematical. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate. In particular the depiction of this Terrace 1 on maps, particularly in the lower Avon, is suspect. It is divided into 1a and 1b &quot;facets&quot;, which might be expected to converge with the Power House (Terrace 1) and Worcester (2) of the Severn, respectively. However the Power House, at least, is [supposedly] below the floodplain at the confluence, whereas patches of Avon Terrace 1, as far down as the confluence, lie 1 to 2m above. Actually depiction of the Severn Terraces might be wrong; some supposed Terrace 2 &quot;islands&quot; in the floodplain are almost certainly Terrace 1. Knock-on implications are that some of Terrace 3 should be 2, and so on.@en',FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

The complex includes fresh and brackish water peats, salt marsh clays, fluvial silts and fine-grained sands, marine sands, and beach-face sands and gravels. In centre of the Fen Basin, five stratigraphical units are present. In ascending order these are basal sand and gravel, the Fen Lower Peat, Barroway Drove Beds, Nordelph Peat and Terrington Beds. Barroway Drove Beds comprise intertidal soft grey clays and silty clays cut by tidal channels and creeks infilled with silt and fine-grained sand. Terrington Beds comprise marine and brackish water silts and fine-grained sands. Marine sands and gravels marginal to the Fen Basin are the Woodstone Member (silty clays and fine sands), the March Gravel Member (sandy gravel to clayey pebbly sand) and the Abbey Sand and Gravel Member (clayey, sandy gravels).@en;Clay, silt and sand with sporadic dropstones. For details of lithologies see entries for constituent members.@en;Shelly silts and sands with a marine fauna (known only from boreholes).@en;The Clydebank Clay Formation comprises mainly clay and silt, with subsidiart sand and gravel deposits, forming four members (q.v.): from oldest to youngest these are the Buchanan Clay, Longhaugh Sand and Gravel, Erskine Clay and Gourock Sand members. More detail of the lithologies of the individual members is included in the related Lexicon entries.@en;The Clyde Clay Formation has six members, from oldest to youngest - the Bridgeton Sand consists of beds of fine- to medium-grained sand, and sandy fine to coarse gravel in an upward-fining succession. The Paisley Clay consists of clays and silts, finely colour banded in shades of greyish brown, grey and reddish brown. The Linwood Clay consists of thickly bedded to massive silts, clayey silts and silty clays, medium to dark grey becoming brownish grey downwards, with sand layers, black sulphide bands and many marine shells. The Killearn Sand and Gravel is commonly reddish brown and yellow, fine- to medium-grained sand with clay layers and beds of gravel. The Inverleven Gravel typically is angular to subrounded boulders, cobbles and gravel in a clayey sand matrix with barnacles. The Balloch Clay consists of clayey silt, silt, clay and sand, mid to dark grey, brownish grey and locally reddish brown, bedded and thinly laminated, normal and reverse graded units, with dark sulphide patches and rare marine shells. Their stratigraphical relationships and geographical distribution are summarized in Browne and McMillan, 1989a, Figures 2b, c and d, 3A, B, C and D and 4A, B and C.)@en;This formation, which underlies much of the marshland in the Great Yarmouth district, is dominated by unconsolidated silt and clay with a shelly marine fauna. Sand is generally a minor component, though locally substantial sand bodies interrupt the argillaceous succession. Peat, of freshwater and brackish origins, is a major component adjacent to much of the marshland margin and particularly in the valleys of the River Yare and tributary streams. If also occurs as three widespread though locally inpersistent layers, at the base of the formation, within it, and at the top, mainly in the marshalnd fringe.@en;Sands and gravels. The sands are fine-grained and quartzose, with beds of comminuted shell. The gravels, which are composed of Chalk flint, quartz, sandstone, cherts, rounded lumps of red, green and grey Triassic mudstones and Liassic fossils, are marine in origin with a few interbedded palaeosols and freshwater sands. They contain fossilised marine, fresh water and terrestrial shells and remains of elephant, rhinoceras, horse, auroch, red, fallow and roe deer, hyaena and wolf. The marine shells indicate both cold and warm water climates and sandy, muddy and rocky habitat, and the freshwater shell Corbicula fluminalis indicates a climate warmer than now. The deposits form low mounds protruding through the surface of the Holocene silts and clays of the Somerset Levels Formation.@en;Clayey silt and clay, commonly rooty and structureless; also highly laminated with silt and very fine- to medium-, locally coarse-grained sand with pebbles up to 5mm and fragments of vivianite; grey and brownish grey, finely micaceous, dark sulphidic patches. In sand dominated successions in outer estuary situations, coarse gravel also occurs at the base of the local member.

(B) Dating of this terrace is contentious; as yet the crucial Fladbury Bed beneath it has no age-diagnostic fauna and its C14 date of c.38K (within MIS 3) may be a minimum. (C) Terrace surface typically some 5m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.9m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation. (G) Only 50K maps on the main course of the Avon are listed.

The unit is referred to here as the Frog Hall Member as this is the name used in Bowen 1999. For consistency with other members in this part of the framework it should perhaps be Frog Hall Sand and Gravel Member. (B) The temperate ?Frog Member? (= Frog Hall Bed[s] of manuscripts) is included here in the Frog Hall [Sand and Gravel] Member, though Maddy had this as a member in its own right in Bowen (1999). (C) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene.@en;(a) This unit may be superfluous in the Avon scheme. (b) The &quot;terrace&quot; top and deposit base at the type locality lie within the 4th/Cropthorne envelope, suggesting the deposits should be classified as Cropthorne Member. Supposed MIS 7 organic deposits beneath it strengthen the case. (c) However, it has been mapped as Terrace 5/Pershore Member. It does indeed lie 6m or so above a nearby terrace outcrop mapped as Terrace 4/Cropthorne. If it were Pershore Member MIS 9 organics might be expected beneath it. &quot;Dating&quot; to MIS7, based solely on &quot;aminostratigraphy&quot;, could be wrong - apparently C fluminalis (to strengthen the Stage 7 case) has not been found. (d) Thus an extra Member is not needed: the unit should be reclassified as Cropthorne (ie BGS maps are wrong) or as Pershore Member. The former is most likely: probably it is a dissected remnant of a valley-side head fan, derived from Pershore gravels, but contemporaneous with the Cropthorne, and somewhat higher than the true Cropthorne terrace flat. Such fans extending uphill from the Cropthorne terrace are commonplace in the upper Avon. (d) Terrace surface at type locality c.40-42m OD, ie, c.30m above the modern Avon. (e) Upper boundary described as ?ground surface? but head might intervene.[Precis of notes from MGS]@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as Cropthorne Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Cropthorne Member. (B) Terrace surface typically some 11 to 15m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.25m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate.However, despite problems with lower terraces, it appears that the Cropthorne (Avon 4) meets the Kidderminster Station (Severn 4) fairly convincingly. (E) Accounts prior to Bowen (1999) include deposits now separated as the Strensham Member.@en;(A) Here named the Pershore Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999) and also in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is simply Pershore Member. (B) Terrace surface some 40m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain at type locality, where it includes the organic Allesborough Bed (the Pershore Fossil bed of Maddy et al., 1991) at base, which is assigned to MIS 9. Probably equates with Frog Hall Member of the upstream Avon/Leam, and with Bushley Green Member of the Severn Valley Formation. (C) Upper Boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) The Avon, and also Severn, terraces need reviewing in their entirety and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect, so the list of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. It is likely that some deposits classified as Pershore (Terrace 5) on existing maps are too low and should actually be classified as Cropthorne (4). That aside, despite some problems of correlation with other terraces, on the basis of elevation, it seems that the correspondence of the Pershore and Bushley Green members between the Avon and Severn, is fairly good.@en;(A) Here named the Wasperton Sand and Gravel though it is simply Wasperton Member in Bowen 1999, and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Dating of this terrace is contentious; as yet the crucial Fladbury Bed beneath it has no age-diagnostic fauna and its C14 date of c.38K (within MIS 3) may be a minimum. (C) Terrace surface typically some 5m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.9m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation. (G) Only 50K maps on the main course of the Avon are listed. Terrace 2 appears on several other maps in the catchment, up tributary steams and so on, (see Warwickshire Avon Valley Formation for complete list) but whether this is really the Wasperton Member is unclear.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the New Inn Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use it was simply New Inn Member. (B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Hence information relating to  Previous Names is necessarily an approximation.@en;(A) the unit is referred to here as Bretford Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Bretford Member. (B) Terrace surface is typically some 2m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain; locally with a lower facet c.1m above the floodplain, with deposits extending beneath the latter. Best developed in the upper Avon. Correlation with members of the Severn Valley Formation is problematical. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate. In particular the depiction of this Terrace 1 on maps, particularly in the lower Avon, is suspect. It is divided into 1a and 1b &quot;facets&quot;, which might be expected to converge with the Power House (Terrace 1) and Worcester (2) of the Severn, respectively. However the Power House, at least, is [supposedly] below the floodplain at the confluence, whereas patches of Avon Terrace 1, as far down as the confluence, lie 1 to 2m above. Actually depiction of the Severn Terraces might be wrong; some supposed Terrace 2 &quot;islands&quot; in the floodplain are almost certainly Terrace 1.

Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en','Ground surface.@en',NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/M,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,'Hanborough Gravel Member@en','0 to c.6m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_48752;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_49677;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50263;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50264;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50265;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50476;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50631;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50680;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50874;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50918;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50985;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_51363;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_51515;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_51838;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_51966;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_52026;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_52086;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_52112,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,HAN@en,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Hanborough Gravel Member@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/onshoreOffshore/ONSHORE,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1628;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1633;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1909;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1631;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1908;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1910;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1912,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Predominantly cold phase sands and gravels that underlie the Hanborough or Fourth Terrace of BGS Maps.

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

It is divided into 1a and 1b &quot;facets&quot;, which might be expected to converge with the Power House (Terrace 1) and Worcester (2) of the Severn, respectively. However the Power House, at least, is [supposedly] below the floodplain at the confluence, whereas patches of Avon Terrace 1, as far down as the confluence, lie 1 to 2m above.

The unit is referred to here as the Frog Hall Member as this is the name used in Bowen 1999. For consistency with other members in this part of the framework it should perhaps be Frog Hall Sand and Gravel Member. (B) The temperate ?Frog Member? (= Frog Hall Bed[s] of manuscripts) is included here in the Frog Hall [Sand and Gravel] Member, though Maddy had this as a member in its own right in Bowen (1999). (C) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene.@en;(a) This unit may be superfluous in the Avon scheme. (b) The &quot;terrace&quot; top and deposit base at the type locality lie within the 4th/Cropthorne envelope, suggesting the deposits should be classified as Cropthorne Member. Supposed MIS 7 organic deposits beneath it strengthen the case. (c) However, it has been mapped as Terrace 5/Pershore Member. It does indeed lie 6m or so above a nearby terrace outcrop mapped as Terrace 4/Cropthorne. If it were Pershore Member MIS 9 organics might be expected beneath it. &quot;Dating&quot; to MIS7, based solely on &quot;aminostratigraphy&quot;, could be wrong - apparently C fluminalis (to strengthen the Stage 7 case) has not been found. (d) Thus an extra Member is not needed: the unit should be reclassified as Cropthorne (ie BGS maps are wrong) or as Pershore Member. The former is most likely: probably it is a dissected remnant of a valley-side head fan, derived from Pershore gravels, but contemporaneous with the Cropthorne, and somewhat higher than the true Cropthorne terrace flat. Such fans extending uphill from the Cropthorne terrace are commonplace in the upper Avon. (d) Terrace surface at type locality c.40-42m OD, ie, c.30m above the modern Avon. (e) Upper boundary described as ?ground surface? but head might intervene.[Precis of notes from MGS]@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as Cropthorne Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Cropthorne Member. (B) Terrace surface typically some 11 to 15m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.25m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate.However, despite problems with lower terraces, it appears that the Cropthorne (Avon 4) meets the Kidderminster Station (Severn 4) fairly convincingly. (E) Accounts prior to Bowen (1999) include deposits now separated as the Strensham Member.@en;(A) Here named the Pershore Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999) and also in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is simply Pershore Member. (B) Terrace surface some 40m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain at type locality, where it includes the organic Allesborough Bed (the Pershore Fossil bed of Maddy et al., 1991) at base, which is assigned to MIS 9. Probably equates with Frog Hall Member of the upstream Avon/Leam, and with Bushley Green Member of the Severn Valley Formation. (C) Upper Boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) The Avon, and also Severn, terraces need reviewing in their entirety and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect, so the list of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. It is likely that some deposits classified as Pershore (Terrace 5) on existing maps are too low and should actually be classified as Cropthorne (4). That aside, despite some problems of correlation with other terraces, on the basis of elevation, it seems that the correspondence of the Pershore and Bushley Green members between the Avon and Severn, is fairly good.@en;(A) Here named the Wasperton Sand and Gravel though it is simply Wasperton Member in Bowen 1999, and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Dating of this terrace is contentious; as yet the crucial Fladbury Bed beneath it has no age-diagnostic fauna and its C14 date of c.38K (within MIS 3) may be a minimum. (C) Terrace surface typically some 5m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.9m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation. (G) Only 50K maps on the main course of the Avon are listed. Terrace 2 appears on several other maps in the catchment, up tributary steams and so on, (see Warwickshire Avon Valley Formation for complete list) but whether this is really the Wasperton Member is unclear.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the New Inn Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use it was simply New Inn Member. (B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Hence information relating to  Previous Names is necessarily an approximation.@en;(A) the unit is referred to here as Bretford Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999, and in previous BGS use it was simply Bretford Member. (B) Terrace surface is typically some 2m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain; locally with a lower facet c.1m above the floodplain, with deposits extending beneath the latter. Best developed in the upper Avon. Correlation with members of the Severn Valley Formation is problematical. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate. In particular the depiction of this Terrace 1 on maps, particularly in the lower Avon, is suspect. It is divided into 1a and 1b &quot;facets&quot;, which might be expected to converge with the Power House (Terrace 1) and Worcester (2) of the Severn, respectively. However the Power House, at least, is [supposedly] below the floodplain at the confluence, whereas patches of Avon Terrace 1, as far down as the confluence, lie 1 to 2m above. Actually depiction of the Severn Terraces might be wrong; some supposed Terrace 2 &quot;islands&quot; in the floodplain are almost certainly Terrace 1. Knock-on implications are that some of Terrace 3 should be 2, and so on.@en',FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;INFORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

River terrace deposits of the middle and lower Thames contain gravel clasts mainly composed of flint, vein quartz and local bedrock lithologies including chert. The terrace deposits are depicted on British Geological Survey maps using numbered terrace symbols.

(BGS Sheets 114, 115 and ?102 and ?128).@en;Currently only known in Type Area (on Sheet 114; see Brandon and Sumbler, 1988, Fig.1): possibly remnants might occur elsewhere on BGS Sheet 113 and possibly on sheets 114 and 102.@en;Distributed along the east side of the present Witham valley from Southrey [TF 13 66] to Kirkstead [TF 19 60] (where it passes onto the Thorpe Member of the Bain). Distribution elsewhere uncertain but correlatives probably present northwest (upstream) of Southrey along the Barlings Eau or River Langworth, to the Langworth area [TF 06 76 (BGS sheets 102, 114, 115, ?128). Correlatives up the Langworth River are unlikely to be quartzite-rich and more probably are like the Thorpe Sand and Gravel of the Bain, so it is questionable if they should be included as Southrey Sand and Gravel Member per se.@en;Currently only known around the Type locality but likely to be more widepsread flanking the Balderton Terrace between Newark-on-Trent and the Lincoln Gap (see Brandon and Sumbler, 1991, Fig.1) and perhaps elsewhere (BGS sheets 114, ?126).@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/INDEX;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Sand and gravel, with possible lenses of silt, clay or peat.

The upper part locally includes a rubified palaeosol (Hykeham Soil; Ipswichian). The Member is correlated with the Ockbrook Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation) and Knighton Sand and Gravel Member (Soar Valley Formation).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Fulbeck Terrace. Typically a clean, well-sorted medium-grained sand with gravel that at depth is dominated by subangular and subrounded pebbles of Jurassic limestone (mainly Lias Group and Lincolnshire Limestone Formation), with a smaller proportion of other Jurassic lithologies, flint, &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite, etc, derived from older drift deposits. Commonly appears dominated by &quot;Bunter&quot; and flint pebbles near the surface due to decalcification. Infills a shallow channel partly coinciding with the valley of the modern River Brant, extending northnortheastwards from Woolsthorpe to Auborne. Terrace surface falls to c.6m OD at the northern end where the deposits are covered by Brant alluvium and probably are truncated by the deeper channel of the River Witham. Sections show cryogenic involutions and epigenetic ice wedge casts infilled with coversand. Basal part locally includes channel-filling organic silts (Little Syke Bed), which yield a temperate fauna and flora assigned to MIS 5e. Correlated with Beeston Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation), and Scarle Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en;Gravels, sands and loams that underlie the Hemington Terrace. Forms a terrace typically c.0.5 to 1m above the modern floodplain in the type area, and often distinguishable from the latter by the presence of mediaeval ridge and furrow. Generally comprises a lower unit of planar cross-bedded (laterally accreted, meandering river) gravel (up to 5m) and an upper unit of overbank silt (up to 2m); may also include organic muds in channels at the base. Gravel much as Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel, i.e. dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (c.80\%) with subordinate subangular flint, etc., but typically less sandy and orange-brown (not pinkish).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Holme Pierrepont Terrace.

The former are typically dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, etc. but the latter have a greater proportion of flint and local Jurassic limestone, etc. Surface c.1 to 2m above the Trent floodplain, at Spalford, and typically 3 to 6m below Witham floodplain level in the Type Area. West of the Lincoln Gap, correlated with the Holme Pierrepont Member (Trent Valley Formation); whilst east of Lincoln Gap also includes older materials correlated with the Scarle and Fulbeck Sand and Gravel members (Trent Valley Formation) and Castle Sand and Gravel Member (Bain Valley Formation).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Martin Terrace of the lower Witham valley. At surface, dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, etc. Terrace preserved as extensive dissected remnants at c.+18m in the Type Area, i.e about 16m above the Witham Floodplain there. Correlated with the Eagle Moor Sand and Gravel west of the Lincoln Gap.@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Scarle Terrace. Gravel dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint, and rarer Triassic sandstone, Lias limestone, etc. Infills a shallow channel diverging from the Trent at Collingham and extending northnortheastwards to North Scarle where it is apparently truncated by the Kirkstead Sand and Gravel Member. Surface is c.3 to 4m above the Trent floodplain, and up to c.2m above the adjoining Kirkstead/Holme Pierrepont Terrace. Correlated with Beeston Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation), and Fulbeck Sand and Gravel Member (Proto-Trent).@en;Predominantly cold-phase sands and gravels that underlie the Southrey Terrace. At surface, dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite (c.60\%) with subordinate subangular flint, etc. (c.40\%). Terrace surface highly dissected but rises to c.6 to 7m above the Witham floodplain in the Type Area. Associated silts yielding a temperate flora and fauna occur at at least two sites; these might occur at the base of the unit but relationships are uncertain. Correlated with the Balderton Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation, west of the Lincoln Gap) and the Egginton Sand and Gravel Member (Trent Valley Formation).@en;Reddened sands and gravels dominated by rounded pebbles of &quot;Bunter&quot; quartz/quartzite with subordinate subangular flint. Underlies possible terrace remnants adjacent to the outcrop of the Balderton Sand and Gravel and with a terrace surface standing typically c.4 to 5m above the Balderton Terrace.

definition compiler notes: At Newark itself this terrace seems to be at c.18m, which (depending upon how the profile is drawn) could read as only 7m above the Trent - hence previous confusion with the Beeston Terrace. However, the terrace here could be degraded in some way, because it is slightly higher than this &quot;downstream&quot;. If the profile is projected back towards Newark it &quot;ought&quot; to be 10 or 11m above the modern floodplain.@en;Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en;Partly because of misunderstandings about the age relationships, Howard (in Bowen, 1999) ascribed the downstream end of the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel (which would lie on Sheet 114) as a separate Bassingham Fen Member. The latter name is superfluous and is now subsumed into the Fulbeck Sand and Gravel.@en;As defined  this is a rather unsatisfactory portmanteau term to cover all the younger sands and gravels of the Proto-Trent and Witham areas that are not otherwise named. Very little is known about these deposits so  more specific names have not yet ben applied. Younger parts include Witham gravels of local derivation and, mainly on Sheet 102, there are deposits that might represent southwards outflow from Lake Humber.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

named the Spring Hill Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999 and also the BGS computer codes list have Spring Hill Member. (B) Terrace surface some 55m above modern Severn alluvial floodplain in the Worcester area, descending to about 45m downstream, at type locality, in the southern part of Sheet 216. Probably represents downstream equivalent of the Dunsmore Gravel Member of the Wolston Formation, ie. Anglian outwash terrace (and younger than the Woolridge Gravel Member, which occurs in the lower Severn valley). (C) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) Severn terraces, particularly the older ones, need reviewing and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect ? hence the section of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. The Spring Hill as such was not recognised prior to BGS work on sheet 216, although some outcrops of ?Sixth Terrace?, which (mostly) seem to be Spring Hill, were mapped on Sheet 182. On Sheet 234 some high gravels are classified as Wills? Woolridge Terrace, which is now (as Woolridge Member) included in the Wolston Formation (outwash gravels) but some look more likely to be Spring Hill on the basis of elevation. (E) According to the compiler?s favoured scheme for a two-phase Anglian (believed to be the only one that fits the evidence, despite the so-far missing stage 11 interglacial) the Spring Hill is Stage 10 distal outwash and the Woolridge Stage 12, probably more proximal, outwash. This accords with the ages assigned in Bowen (1999).@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN

The gravels are characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and by felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially-fractured sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and formations and members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel. The aggradations are generally entrenched into bedrock with a difference in surface elevation of at least 5m. The upper part of the gravels which dominate the subgroup are commonly affected by pedogenesis. The Valley Farm Soil is a rubified and clay-enriched horizon affecting the top 1.0-1.5m and indicating warm interglacial conditions.

(B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area.

The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en;Compiler?s Notes: (A) Unit named the Hanborough Gravel Member though in Bowen 1989 and in the former BGS list of computer codes it is Hanborough Member. Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, the change is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 30m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, and (apparently) an approximately similar height elsewhere. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en;(A) The unit is referred to here as the Northmoor Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Northmoor Member. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en;(A) Here named Wolvercote Sand and Gravel though in Bowen (1999) and in the previous BGS list of computer codes it is Wolvercote Member. (B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en',FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL;FORMAL,NaN
