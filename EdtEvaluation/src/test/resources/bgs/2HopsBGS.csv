(E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene.

(B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect.

As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect. Prior to Sumbler 2001, the outcrops now recognized in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) were included in ?Moreton Drift? and there is indeed a component of glaciofluvial outwash there.@en','rock:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasSupplementaryInformation:::Bridgland, 1994','rock:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasSupplementaryInformation:::Whiteman, 1992','rock:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasSupplementaryInformation:::view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986',rock:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasSupplementaryInformation:::traditional&quot,'rock:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasSupplementaryInformation:::(A) The unit is referred to here as Freeland Sand and Gravel Member though in Bowen (1999), and in previous BGS use, it was simply Freeland Member. (B) Following the &quot','rock:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasSupplementaryInformation:::Clayton, Posnansky, etc, wrongly correlated the type Beeston Sand and Gravel with the older Balderton Sand and Gravel downstream, and also (it appears) with the younger Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel upstream. The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel. On Sheet 126 (Nottingham) it is named the Bassingfield Sand and Gravel (see above). I would not expect it to be present significantly downstream of Newark because [in my opinion] the river followed the Proto-Trent route at the time, where it is [probably] represented by the Scarle Sand and Gravel.@en','rock:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasSupplementaryInformation:::have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds.

(D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation.

Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The gravels of the formation are characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. These lithologies form a lower percentage than in the Sudbury Formation, and are believed to be derived from that formation, but mega-erratics and felsic volcanic rocks from Wales and the Welsh borderland occur with a  generally greater frequency than in the Sudbury Formation. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and the members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel. The aggredations are generally entrenched into bedrock with a difference in surface elevation in the order of 5m. Intraformational ice wedge casts and pollen indicate periglacial, cool temperate and warm temperate climates.@en','rock:::http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#broader:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription:::Alluvial gravel, sand, silt and clay forming floodplains, alluvial fans and river terrace deposits, peat, mud and pebbly sand infilling lowland basins and blanketing upland hillsides and peat, humic clayey silt and calcareous silt infilling kettleholes.@en','rock:::http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#broader:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription:::subordinate red mudstone and siltstone.@en','rock:::http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#broader:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription:::Sandstone, red, yellow and brown, part pebbly','rock:::http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#broader:::http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription:::quartzite of Triassic derivation, and of vein quartz, Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks are local important constituents.

Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The formation represents the first significant input of far-travelled materials into the Thames river sediments, and is characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially fractures sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and the members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel.

(D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true. (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Sherborne Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en',facets&quot,'(A) Here named the Summertown-Radley Sand and Gravel Member, though simply Summertown-Radley Member in Bowen 1999 and in the previous BGS list of computer codes.

(C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace.

(B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, this is OK as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface some 8m above modern alluvial floodplain at the type locality and (apparently) elsewhere. Locally extends below the level of the Northmoor Terrace. Includes the Stanton Harcourt Bed (organic muds, MIS 7) and the Eynsham Beds (fossiliferous gravel, MIS5e). Locally, upper and lower &quot;facets&quot; have been recognised (2b and 2a of BGS maps), these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by the organic beds. (D) Upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (D) A different type locality (Summertown) to that specified in Bowen, 1999 (Radley) is specified for several reasons. However, this is of merely historical interest as the Primary Reference section is much more significant and much better described. (E) Relatively recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and probably the converse is also true.

The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out.

The Bassingfield Sand and Gravel of Sheet 126 is, given the fact that it is cleary somewhat degraded, at the right elevation to be Beeston (and too low to be Egginton Common/Balderton) and was correlated with the type Beeston by Clayton, etc. In my opinion it is Beeston Sand and Gravel. However, Lowe (1989) and Charsley et al. have it as a separate entity, presumably because they say it passes down into, and intercalates with sandy pebbly clay which they interpret as a glacial melt-out. But I suspect it more likely that these are contemporaneous head gravels etc. Currently this unit is only distinguished as such on Sheet 141 (Loughborough). It is undoubtedly present upstream, but the distribution shown by Clayton (1953) would seem to be mostly Holme Pierrepont Sand and Gravel.

(B) Following the &quot;traditional&quot; view, this unit was placed in the Northern Drift Formation by Bowen, 1999 (i.e. (?)Kesgrave Formation of the current scheme). However, Sumbler (2001) showed that it is the oldest unit of the [Upper] Thames Valley Formation. In fact few would dispute this because, even before 2001, this was generally accepted (e.g. Hey, 1986; Whiteman, 1992; Bridgland, 1994; in fact most except Gibbard) as the correlative of the Black Park of the Middle Thames. As this is essentially an Anglian outwash terrace, even then it was accepted implicitly that the Freeland postdated the truncation of the extended proto-Thames ?Northern Drift or Kesgrave River?. (C) Terrace surface is some 40m above modern (Evenlode) alluvial floodplain at the type locality, diminishing somewhat upstream. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Apart from at the type locality, recognition of this terrace is based on elevation, and in some areas (notably on Sheet 236, 253 and 254) the mapping is suspect.

In northern East Anglia the very chalky tills commonly referred to informally as the &quot;marly drift&quot; were generally included within the Lowestoft Formation, but recent work has indicated that these may belong to a younger glaciation. Likewise, chalky tills in the south and east Midlands have commonly been linked with the Lowestoft Formation, but these may also be younger.

(B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area.

(B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect.

(B) The terrace surface is some 15m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain (e.g at type locality) apparently decreasing to perhaps 10m downstream. (C) The terrace is not well defined morphologically and it seems too high and close to Terrace 4 (Cropthorne). Moreover, on the basis of elevation, it looks as if some supposed Terrace 3 downstream might actually be Terrace 2 (or less probably, vice versa). It might actually include head or tributary fluvial gravels, perhaps equivalent to older parts of the Wasperton (2) Member which is quite probably composite. Correlation with the Severn is a problem: Terrace 3 (Holt Heath) of the Severn also apparently has 5e organic material beneath, but is outwash from the main Devensian Icesheet, which is supposedly stage 2. In any case, as mapped, the Holt Heath looks too low to meet with the Avon?s New Inn, but could just about relate to the Avon?s Wasperton Member. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) As stated above, the Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect.

Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The formation represents the first significant input of far-travelled materials into the Thames river sediments, and is characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially fractures sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and the members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel.

Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The formation represents the first significant input of far-travelled materials into the Thames river sediments, and is characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially fractures sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and the members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel.

At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991).

(B) Parent was formerly Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation issues at Goring, revision is acceptable as member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C) Terrace surface c.12m above modern alluvial floodplain at type locality, and (apparently) elsewhere. At type locality, Wolvercote Channel Beds (temperature fauna, ?MIS 9) probably underlie the gravels (ie, older) but may be within them (contemporaneous) or incised into them (younger). (D) Dating depends only partly on Wolvercote Channel. More important is relationship with ?Moreton Drift? at the head of the Evenlode (see below). The presence of flint is critical to the interpretation - debate has arisen about whether or not it is the oldest terrace to contain ?significant? amounts of flint (Maddy et al., 1991). (E) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? but head, colluvium or soil may intervene. (F) Terrace is weakly developed and poorly defined, so recognition based on elevation is suspect in places; some mapping is dubious. Deposits mapped as ?Third terrace? are not necessarily Wolvercote. The feeble development of the terrace is rather surprising, particularly if it is primarily late Anglian outwash derived from the Moreton Drift. However, this all came down the Evenlode; whilst there is a fairly good flinty outwash terrace in the Upper Evenlode (Sheet 235, 218) where (as the correlation is contentiousness) the name Daylesford Member is used. The Lower Evenlode valley is narrow and incised where it cuts through the Great Oolite limestones (so-called Evenlode Gorge) and perhaps was cleaned out at a later stage. (G) The identity of Terrace 3 on Sheet 218 is questionable. Most of the Evenlode Terrace 3 seems to be Daylesford Member (which may or may not equate with Wolvercote). That in the Cherwell valley may be Wolvercote, but mapping is suspect.@en','Ground surface.@en',NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/M,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,'Wolvercote Sand And Gravel Member@en','0 to c,3m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_48752;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_49677;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50263;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50264;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50265;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50631;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50680;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50874;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50918;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_50985;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51002;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51363;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51515;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51838;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_51966;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_52086;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_52112;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_52988;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WV_53046,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,WV@en,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Wolvercote Sand And Gravel Member@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/onshoreOffshore/ONSHORE,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4171;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4173;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4662;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4663;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4168;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4660;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WV___mn__4661,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Predominantly cold phase sands and gravels that underlie the Wolvercote or Third Terrace of BGS maps.

Obviously Lower Severn would seem appropriate. The Upper Severn is entirely within the Devensian limit - in pre-Devensian times it was probably a tributary of the Dee.This is a common problem with rivers that have had major diversions during the Pleistocene e.g. Thames and Trent. (B) The list of members relates to the ?lower Severn? below Bridgnorth but even there might not be fully comprehensive if ?awkward? rivers like the Teme (see below) are included. (C) It is impractical to give a fully comprehensive definition of the base in lithological terms. (D) The Upper Boundary might need modification if head etc is not included in this type of Formation. (E) Thickness estimates are subject to possible modification. (F) Listed 50K sheets are those that include a portion of the entire Severn catchment. More work might be needed to decide if some rivers like the Teme (the valley of which includes pre-Devensian terraces related to the River Wye!), or indeed the Upper (later Devensian) Severn (see above) should be included.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'0 to c.10m@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Severn catchment (excluding Warwickshire Avon).@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Though previously considered a river terrace deposit of the Severn and its tributaries in the West Midlands, Maddy (1997) has defined this as a Late Wolstonian glaciofluvial  outwash deposit.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Stratotype/38689,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Stratotype/40481,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Present day terrace flat.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Where river deposits rest on bedrock, or glacial deposits.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Mid Pleistocene to Holocene (MI Stages ?11 or 9 to 1).@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/SPHT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/PSTT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/KRT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/HHTD,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BGT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'glacial material from the Devensian Stockport Formation.@en','Irish Sea&quot','members (Spring Hill, Bushley Green, Kidderminster Station, Holt Heath, Worcester, Power House members), plus Holocene alluvium (Elmore Member of Bowen, 1999) and with local named organic deposits.

Mainly sand, gravel and mud; divided into six &quot;terrace&quot; members (Spring Hill, Bushley Green, Kidderminster Station, Holt Heath, Worcester, Power House members), plus Holocene alluvium (Elmore Member of Bowen, 1999) and with local named organic deposits. Includes contemporaneous head, colluvium and soil deposits. Gravels are principally composed of Palaeozoic, Triassic and (mainly below Avon confluence at Tewkesbury) Jurassic material from the local bedrock of the catchment, with an admixture of glacial material from the Anglian Wolston Formation, etc. and, in the younger terraces, a substantial admixture of &quot;Irish Sea&quot; glacial material from the Devensian Stockport Formation.@en','Severn Valley Formation@en','(A) The name may need changing if it is decided that the Upper Severn should be excluded. Obviously Lower Severn would seem appropriate. The Upper Severn is entirely within the Devensian limit - in pre-Devensian times it was probably a tributary of the Dee.This is a common problem with rivers that have had major diversions during the Pleistocene e.g. Thames and Trent. (B) The list of members relates to the ?lower Severn? below Bridgnorth but even there might not be fully comprehensive if ?awkward? rivers like the Teme (see below) are included. (C) It is impractical to give a fully comprehensive definition of the base in lithological terms. (D) The Upper Boundary might need modification if head etc is not included in this type of Formation. (E) Thickness estimates are subject to possible modification. (F) Listed 50K sheets are those that include a portion of the entire Severn catchment. More work might be needed to decide if some rivers like the Teme (the valley of which includes pre-Devensian terraces related to the River Wye!), or indeed the Upper (later Devensian) Severn (see above) should be included.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/F,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/CurrentStatus/CURRENT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,SEVN@en,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,'Severn catchment (excluding Warwickshire Avon).@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BGT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/HHTD;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/KRT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/PSTT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/SPHT,'0 to c.10m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Theme/SPRFCL,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SpatialScope/GENRAL,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/?,NaN,NaN

(B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area.

Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area.

(B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area. (E) As this unit is not actually distinguished on any BGS maps (locally its component members are) the listing of 50K sheets is actually superfluous, but a list is included to show the areas where the Wolston Formation should encompass the glacial deposits.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/F,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/CurrentStatus/CURRENT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,WOLS@en,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,'English Midlands east of Birmingham, and as far south as the Moreton-in-Marsh and Tewkesbury areas.

(B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation. Despite correlation problems at Goring, I am happy with this as the member names in the Upper Thames remain discrete. (C)Terrace surface is up to 3m above modern alluvial floodplain, with Northmoor deposits of at least two phases (MIS 5?a and Late Glacial MIS 2). Locally, upper (c 2-3m) and lower (c 1m) ?facets? have been recognised (1b and 1a of BGS maps); these do not necessarily relate to the two phases of aggradation suggested by these organic beds. (D) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (E) Recent work on sections shows that some deposits mapped as Summertown-Radley are in fact Northmoor, and the primary reference locality is mapped as alluvium (this could be correct, as the gravels extend beneath the alluvium, but in this case it is probably wrong). (F) There do not appear to be equivalents on the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 218, 235) and in the Upper Windrush (also on Sheet 235) a different name (Rissington Member) is used because of the lack of positive correlation. The name is (probably) applicable in the Cherwell valley on Sheet 218.@en','Ground surface or floodplain alluvium.@en',NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/M,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,'Northmoor Sand And Gravel Member@en','0 to c 6 or 7m, typically c 3m.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_48752;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_49677;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_50263;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_50264;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_50265;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_50270;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_50631;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_50680;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_50874;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_50918;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_50985;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_51363;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_51515;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_51838;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_51885;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_51966;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_52112;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_53017;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/NO_53046,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NO@en,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/NO1A;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/NO1B,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Northmoor Sand And Gravel Member@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/onshoreOffshore/ONSHORE,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/NO___mn__1569;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/NO___mn__1570;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/NO___mn__1593;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/NO___mn__1594;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/NO___mn__3089;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/NO___mn__3092;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/NO___mn__1573;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/NO___mn__1574;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/NO___mn__1595,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Predominantly cold phase sands and gravels that underlie the Northmoor or First Terrace of BGS Maps.

Obviously Lower Severn would seem appropriate. The Upper Severn is entirely within the Devensian limit - in pre-Devensian times it was probably a tributary of the Dee.This is a common problem with rivers that have had major diversions during the Pleistocene e.g. Thames and Trent. (B) The list of members relates to the ?lower Severn? below Bridgnorth but even there might not be fully comprehensive if ?awkward? rivers like the Teme (see below) are included. (C) It is impractical to give a fully comprehensive definition of the base in lithological terms. (D) The Upper Boundary might need modification if head etc is not included in this type of Formation. (E) Thickness estimates are subject to possible modification. (F) Listed 50K sheets are those that include a portion of the entire Severn catchment. More work might be needed to decide if some rivers like the Teme (the valley of which includes pre-Devensian terraces related to the River Wye!), or indeed the Upper (later Devensian) Severn (see above) should be included.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'0 to c.10m@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Severn catchment (excluding Warwickshire Avon).@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Stratotype/38689,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Stratotype/42303,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'The present day terrace surface.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Where river deposits overlie bedrock or glacial deposits.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Mid Pleistocene to Holocene (MI Stages ?11 or 9 to 1).@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/SPHT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/PSTT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/KRT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/HHTD,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BGT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'glacial material from the Devensian Stockport Formation.@en','Irish Sea&quot','members (Spring Hill, Bushley Green, Kidderminster Station, Holt Heath, Worcester, Power House members), plus Holocene alluvium (Elmore Member of Bowen, 1999) and with local named organic deposits.

Includes contemporaneous head, colluvium and soil deposits. Gravels are principally composed of Palaeozoic, Triassic and (mainly below Avon confluence at Tewkesbury) Jurassic material from the local bedrock of the catchment, with an admixture of glacial material from the Anglian Wolston Formation, etc. and, in the younger terraces, a substantial admixture of &quot;Irish Sea&quot; glacial material from the Devensian Stockport Formation.@en','Severn Valley Formation@en','(A) The name may need changing if it is decided that the Upper Severn should be excluded. Obviously Lower Severn would seem appropriate. The Upper Severn is entirely within the Devensian limit - in pre-Devensian times it was probably a tributary of the Dee.This is a common problem with rivers that have had major diversions during the Pleistocene e.g. Thames and Trent. (B) The list of members relates to the ?lower Severn? below Bridgnorth but even there might not be fully comprehensive if ?awkward? rivers like the Teme (see below) are included. (C) It is impractical to give a fully comprehensive definition of the base in lithological terms. (D) The Upper Boundary might need modification if head etc is not included in this type of Formation. (E) Thickness estimates are subject to possible modification. (F) Listed 50K sheets are those that include a portion of the entire Severn catchment. More work might be needed to decide if some rivers like the Teme (the valley of which includes pre-Devensian terraces related to the River Wye!), or indeed the Upper (later Devensian) Severn (see above) should be included.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/F,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/CurrentStatus/CURRENT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,SEVN@en,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,'Severn catchment (excluding Warwickshire Avon).@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BGT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/HHTD;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/KRT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/PSTT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/SPHT,'0 to c.10m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Theme/SPRFCL,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SpatialScope/GENRAL,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/?,NaN,NaN

Obviously Lower Severn would seem appropriate. The Upper Severn is entirely within the Devensian limit - in pre-Devensian times it was probably a tributary of the Dee.This is a common problem with rivers that have had major diversions during the Pleistocene e.g. Thames and Trent. (B) The list of members relates to the ?lower Severn? below Bridgnorth but even there might not be fully comprehensive if ?awkward? rivers like the Teme (see below) are included.

It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area.

In type area and elsewhere constitutes a succession including a basal reddish-brown Trias-rich till of essentially northern provenance (Thrussington Till Member), glacialacustrine muds ([Wolston or Grounds Farm Member and] Bosworth Clay Member), an upper grey, chalky till with Jurassic and Cretaceous material, essentially of northeastern provenance (Oadby Till Member), and flint-rich outwash gravels (Dunsmore Gravel Member). Characteristically lacks Scottish and Lake districts erratics (which characterise the Devensian Stockport Formation), and western (Welsh, etc.) erratics (which are found in the probably equivalent Nurseries and Ridgacre formations to the west of the Wolston Formation).@en','Wolston Formation@en','(A) The name follows Bowen et al (1999) and BGS provisional Framework document. (B) The consensus view in academia is that this unit is Stage 12 (as per Bowen 1999), but there is evidence to suggest it is younger Stage 10, or both 10 and 12. (C) The succession within the Wolston Formation is only touched upon; neither the Wolston Clay Member nor the synonymous Grounds Farm Member are mentioned. (D) The precise limits of the Wolston Formation are contentious. It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation. Thus the limit in the east is fairly arbitrary, and the northern limit is particularly vague, and probably best left as such until some primary work has been done on the older drifts of the south Pennines area. (E) As this unit is not actually distinguished on any BGS maps (locally its component members are) the listing of 50K sheets is actually superfluous, but a list is included to show the areas where the Wolston Formation should encompass the glacial deposits.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/F,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/CurrentStatus/CURRENT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,WOLS@en,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,'English Midlands east of Birmingham, and as far south as the Moreton-in-Marsh and Tewkesbury areas.

Obviously Lower Severn would seem appropriate. The Upper Severn is entirely within the Devensian limit - in pre-Devensian times it was probably a tributary of the Dee.This is a common problem with rivers that have had major diversions during the Pleistocene e.g. Thames and Trent. (B) The list of members relates to the ?lower Severn? below Bridgnorth but even there might not be fully comprehensive if ?awkward? rivers like the Teme (see below) are included. (C) It is impractical to give a fully comprehensive definition of the base in lithological terms. (D) The Upper Boundary might need modification if head etc is not included in this type of Formation. (E) Thickness estimates are subject to possible modification. (F) Listed 50K sheets are those that include a portion of the entire Severn catchment. More work might be needed to decide if some rivers like the Teme (the valley of which includes pre-Devensian terraces related to the River Wye!), or indeed the Upper (later Devensian) Severn (see above) should be included.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'0 to c.10m@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Severn catchment (excluding Warwickshire Avon).@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,'(A) Now named the Spring Hill Sand and Gravel Member, though in Bowen 1999 and also the BGS computer codes list have Spring Hill Member. (B) Terrace surface some 55m above modern Severn alluvial floodplain in the Worcester area, descending to about 45m downstream, at type locality, in the southern part of Sheet 216. Probably represents downstream equivalent of the Dunsmore Gravel Member of the Wolston Formation, ie. Anglian outwash terrace (and younger than the Woolridge Gravel Member, which occurs in the lower Severn valley). (C) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) Severn terraces, particularly the older ones, need reviewing and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect ? hence the section of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. The Spring Hill as such was not recognised prior to BGS work on sheet 216, although some outcrops of ?Sixth Terrace?, which (mostly) seem to be Spring Hill, were mapped on Sheet 182. On Sheet 234 some high gravels are classified as Wills? Woolridge Terrace, which is now (as Woolridge Member) included in the Wolston Formation (outwash gravels) but some look more likely to be Spring Hill on the basis of elevation. (E) According to the compiler?s favoured scheme for a two-phase Anglian (believed to be the only one that fits the evidence, despite the so-far missing stage 11 interglacial) the Spring Hill is Stage 10 distal outwash and the Woolridge Stage 12, probably more proximal, outwash. This accords with the ages assigned in Bowen (1999).@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NaN,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Stratotype/38689,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Stratotype/42893,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Ground surface.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Unconformable, commonly channelled base on Lower Jurassic or Triassic bedrock.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Mid Pleistocene to Holocene (MI Stages ?11 or 9 to 1).@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/SPHT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/PSTT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/KRT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/HHTD,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BGT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'glacial material from the Devensian Stockport Formation.@en','Irish Sea&quot','members (Spring Hill, Bushley Green, Kidderminster Station, Holt Heath, Worcester, Power House members), plus Holocene alluvium (Elmore Member of Bowen, 1999) and with local named organic deposits.

(B) Terrace surface some 55m above modern Severn alluvial floodplain in the Worcester area, descending to about 45m downstream, at type locality, in the southern part of Sheet 216. Probably represents downstream equivalent of the Dunsmore Gravel Member of the Wolston Formation, ie. Anglian outwash terrace (and younger than the Woolridge Gravel Member, which occurs in the lower Severn valley). (C) Upper Boundary given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) Severn terraces, particularly the older ones, need reviewing and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect ? hence the section of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. The Spring Hill as such was not recognised prior to BGS work on sheet 216, although some outcrops of ?Sixth Terrace?, which (mostly) seem to be Spring Hill, were mapped on Sheet 182. On Sheet 234 some high gravels are classified as Wills? Woolridge Terrace, which is now (as Woolridge Member) included in the Wolston Formation (outwash gravels) but some look more likely to be Spring Hill on the basis of elevation. (E) According to the compiler?s favoured scheme for a two-phase Anglian (believed to be the only one that fits the evidence, despite the so-far missing stage 11 interglacial) the Spring Hill is Stage 10 distal outwash and the Woolridge Stage 12, probably more proximal, outwash.

(E) Thickness estimates are subject to possible modification. (F) Listed 50K sheets are those that include a portion of the entire Severn catchment.

Probably equates with Frog Hall Member of the upstream Avon/Leam, and with Bushley Green Member of the Severn Valley Formation. (C) Upper Boundary is given as ?ground surface? though there may be head, colluvium or soil deposits intervening. (D) The Avon, and also Severn, terraces need reviewing in their entirety and the classification of some outcrops on existing maps is suspect, so the list of Previous Names is necessarily an approximation. It is likely that some deposits classified as Pershore (Terrace 5) on existing maps are too low and should actually be classified as Cropthorne (4). That aside, despite some problems of correlation with other terraces, on the basis of elevation, it seems that the correspondence of the Pershore and Bushley Green members between the Avon and Severn, is fairly good.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/PERT_STRSG,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/AVON___mn__185,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Stratotype/43568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Stratotype/39663,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Ground surface.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Unconformable, commonly channelled base on Lower Jurassic or Triassic bedrock.@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'Mid Pleistocene to Holocene (MI Stages ?11 or 9 to 1).@en',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BRET,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/NIT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/NIAT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/WAT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/WANIT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/PERT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/CRTD,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/STRSG,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/FRHA,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BWAT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/AILT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'quartz/quartzite, flint and Jurassic (mostly Lias) lithologies, derived from the Baginton Formation, Wolston Formation and the local bedrock of the catchment.@en','members (Frog Hall, Pershore, [Strensham], Cropthorne, New Inn, Wasperton and Bretford members), Holocene alluvium (Elmore Member of Bowen, 1999) and with local named organic deposits.

(D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation.

Bowen 1999, and in the previous BGS list of computer codes. (B) Dating of this terrace is contentious; as yet the crucial Fladbury Bed beneath it has no age-diagnostic fauna and its C14 date of c.38K (within MIS 3) may be a minimum. (C) Terrace surface typically some 5m above modern Avon alluvial floodplain in the Rugby area, increasing downstream to c.9m near the confluence with the Severn at Tewkesbury. (D) All things being equal, one this unit might be expected to correspond with the Holt Heath (3) of the Severn (Late Devensian outwash terrace) but the latter seems a few metres lower at the Avon confluence (Tewkesbury) so this isn?t as might be hoped. On the other hand, the Wasperton is too high to meet the Worcester (Terrace 2) of the Severn too! Actually as both the Holt Heath and Wasperton are composite, age-wise, none of this is greatly surprising Nevertheless there might be a problem both with the classification of the Severn terraces, and those of the Avon. (E) The upper boundary is given as ?ground surface? though head, colluvium or soil deposits might intervene. (F) Avon and Severn terraces need reviewing in their entirety and classification of some outcrops on existing maps is highly suspect. Thus the Previous Names are necessarily an approximation. (G) Only 50K maps on the main course of the Avon are listed. Terrace 2 appears on several other maps in the catchment, up tributary steams and so on, (see Warwickshire Avon Valley Formation for complete list) but whether this is really the Wasperton Member is unclear.@en','Ground surface.@en',NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/M,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,1^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,'Wasperton Sand And Gravel Member@en','0 to c.6m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_49128;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_49129;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_50269;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_50373;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_50676;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_50812;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_50918;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_50978;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_51403;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_51682;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_51974;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_52088;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_52614;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/WAT_52703,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,WAT@en,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/WATA;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/WATB,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Wasperton Sand And Gravel Member@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/onshoreOffshore/ONSHORE,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WAT___mn__4537;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WAT___mn__3798;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WAT___mn__3800;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WAT___st__899;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WAT___mn__183;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WAT___mn__3053;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/WAT___mn__3805,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Predominantly cold phase sands and gravels that underlie the Avon  Second Terrace of Tomlinson (1925) and of BGS Maps.

Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The formation represents the first significant input of far-travelled materials into the Thames river sediments, and is characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially fractures sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river.

Note that most other &quot;terrace&quot; units are described as &quot;Sand and Gravel&quot; members. (B) Parent was originally Upper Thames Valley Formation.

(E) Apart from at the type locality the recognition of this terrace is based on elevation. Mapping in some areas may be suspect so not all Fourth Terrace is necessarily the Hanborough. In the Upper Evenlode (Sheets 235, 218) there are limestone gravels that probably include equivalents but this has a different name (Spelsbury Member) because it is probably a composite deposit including younger materials. There is a reasonable Hanborough Member on the Cherwell (128) Sheet, however. There is no truth in the claim (Tomlinson, 1929; Arkell, 1947) that it equates with the Paxford Gravel of the Moreton-in-Marsh area, which underlies the bulk of the Anglian Moreton Drift.@en','Ground surface.@en',NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/M,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,'Hanborough Gravel Member@en','0 to c.6m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_48752;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_49677;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50263;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50264;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50265;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50476;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50631;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50680;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50874;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50918;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_50985;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_51363;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_51515;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_51838;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_51966;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_52026;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_52086;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/HAN_52112,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,HAN@en,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Hanborough Gravel Member@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/onshoreOffshore/ONSHORE,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1628;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1633;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1909;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1631;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1908;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1910;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/HAN___mn__1912,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Predominantly cold phase sands and gravels that underlie the Hanborough or Fourth Terrace of BGS Maps.

(B) Terrace surface is typically some 2m above the modern Avon alluvial floodplain; locally with a lower facet c.1m above the floodplain, with deposits extending beneath the latter. Best developed in the upper Avon. Correlation with members of the Severn Valley Formation is problematical. (C) The upper boundary is given as &quot;ground surface&quot; though head, colluvium or soil deposits may intervene. (D) All Avon (and Severn) terraces need review; classification of some outcrops on existing maps is dubious. Thus some Previous Names are necessarily approximate. In particular the depiction of this Terrace 1 on maps, particularly in the lower Avon, is suspect. It is divided into 1a and 1b &quot;facets&quot;, which might be expected to converge with the Power House (Terrace 1) and Worcester (2) of the Severn, respectively. However the Power House, at least, is [supposedly] below the floodplain at the confluence, whereas patches of Avon Terrace 1, as far down as the confluence, lie 1 to 2m above. Actually depiction of the Severn Terraces might be wrong; some supposed Terrace 2 &quot;islands&quot; in the floodplain are almost certainly Terrace 1. Knock-on implications are that some of Terrace 3 should be 2, and so on.@en','Ground surface.@en','River Terrace.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/M,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,NaN,2^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,'Bretford Sand And Gravel Member@en','0 to 5m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/BRET_49128;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/BRET_49129;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/BRET_50676;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/BRET_50812;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/BRET_50918;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/BRET_50978;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/BRET_51403;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/BRET_52088;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SourceInfo/BRET_52614,NaN,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,BRET@en,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/Q2,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BRETL;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BRETU,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/ShapeType/NotEntered,'Bretford Sand And Gravel Member@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/onshoreOffshore/ONSHORE,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/BRET___mn__595;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/BRET___mn__598;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/BRET___mn__1573;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/BRET___mn__1577;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/BRET___mn__3051;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/BRET___mn__181;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/EquivalentName/BRET___mn__1571,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/DefinitionStatus/FULL,'Predominantly cold phase sands and gravels that underlie the Avon First Terrace of Tomlinson (1925) and of BGS Maps.

Obviously Lower Severn would seem appropriate. The Upper Severn is entirely within the Devensian limit - in pre-Devensian times it was probably a tributary of the Dee.This is a common problem with rivers that have had major diversions during the Pleistocene e.g. Thames and Trent. (B) The list of members relates to the ?lower Severn? below Bridgnorth but even there might not be fully comprehensive if ?awkward? rivers like the Teme (see below) are included.

Mainly sand, gravel and mud; divided into six &quot;terrace&quot; members (Spring Hill, Bushley Green, Kidderminster Station, Holt Heath, Worcester, Power House members), plus Holocene alluvium (Elmore Member of Bowen, 1999) and with local named organic deposits. Includes contemporaneous head, colluvium and soil deposits. Gravels are principally composed of Palaeozoic, Triassic and (mainly below Avon confluence at Tewkesbury) Jurassic material from the local bedrock of the catchment, with an admixture of glacial material from the Anglian Wolston Formation, etc. and, in the younger terraces, a substantial admixture of &quot;Irish Sea&quot; glacial material from the Devensian Stockport Formation.@en','Severn Valley Formation@en','(A) The name may need changing if it is decided that the Upper Severn should be excluded. Obviously Lower Severn would seem appropriate. The Upper Severn is entirely within the Devensian limit - in pre-Devensian times it was probably a tributary of the Dee.This is a common problem with rivers that have had major diversions during the Pleistocene e.g. Thames and Trent. (B) The list of members relates to the ?lower Severn? below Bridgnorth but even there might not be fully comprehensive if ?awkward? rivers like the Teme (see below) are included. (C) It is impractical to give a fully comprehensive definition of the base in lithological terms. (D) The Upper Boundary might need modification if head etc is not included in this type of Formation. (E) Thickness estimates are subject to possible modification. (F) Listed 50K sheets are those that include a portion of the entire Severn catchment. More work might be needed to decide if some rivers like the Teme (the valley of which includes pre-Devensian terraces related to the River Wye!), or indeed the Upper (later Devensian) Severn (see above) should be included.@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/RockUnitRank/F,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/CurrentStatus/CURRENT,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,SEVN@en,0^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer,'Severn catchment (excluding Warwickshire Avon).@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BGT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/HHTD;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/KRT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/PSTT;http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/SPHT,'0 to c.10m@en',http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/Theme/SPRFCL,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/SpatialScope/GENRAL,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit,http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Geochronology/Division/?,NaN,NaN

Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The gravels of the formation are characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. These lithologies form a lower percentage than in the Sudbury Formation, and are believed to be derived from that formation, but mega-erratics and felsic volcanic rocks from Wales and the Welsh borderland occur with a  generally greater frequency than in the Sudbury Formation. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and the members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel. The aggredations are generally entrenched into bedrock with a difference in surface elevation in the order of 5m.

Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The gravels of the formation are characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. These lithologies form a lower percentage than in the Sudbury Formation, and are believed to be derived from that formation, but mega-erratics and felsic volcanic rocks from Wales and the Welsh borderland occur with a  generally greater frequency than in the Sudbury Formation. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and the members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel. The aggredations are generally entrenched into bedrock with a difference in surface elevation in the order of 5m.

It could be taken to the Devensian limit in Lincolnshire but Lewis (in Bowen, 1999) excluded things such as the Wragby Till (putting it in the Lowestoft Formation), which could be included in the Wolston Formation.
